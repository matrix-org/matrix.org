Open Tech Will Save Us is a virtual meetup, taking the form of a monthly live
video stream broadcasting on the last Wednesday of every month at 6pm Paris
time.

We discuss issues relating to technology, especially the importance of Open,
Interoperable standards, and how they can enable decentralised tech to keep our
data private while still enabling communication.
