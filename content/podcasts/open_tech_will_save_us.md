Every last Wednesday of the month, at 18:00 Paris time we broadcast Open Tech
Will Save Us, our live show with guests from the broader open source world. We
try to **understand the social impact of software and how open source can make 
it more positive**.

This show is for every open source enthusiasts, whether they want to hear about
the latest Thunderbird release or why single-sign-on is such a big deal in the
corporate world.

Head to [the Open Tech Will Save Us](/open-tech-will-save-us) page to either 
watch the show live or catch up with the previous issues.
