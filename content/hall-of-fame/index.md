Here we maintain a list of security researchers and their findings, to recognize
them for having responsibly disclosed security issues to us in the past.

If you think you've found a security issue relating to Matrix software or
infrastructure, please see our [Security Disclosure Policy](/security-disclosure-policy)
on how to report it to us.

If you think you should be on the list, apologies if we missed you, please mail
us at [security@matrix.org](mailto:security@matrix.org).
