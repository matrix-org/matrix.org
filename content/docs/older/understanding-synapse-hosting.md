In this tutorial we’re going to deploy a synapse instance with docker-compose.
This tutorial is about getting a first hands-on experience with Synapse, but it
is **NOT** a guide to deploying Synapse in production. Some best practices are
missing for a production server. If you want to deploy Synapse to production,
you most probably want at least:

* Monitoring
* Backups
* Joining the Matrix rooms or subscribing to the mailing-lists/RSS feeds to know
  when one of the components you use has a new release

For production setups, please see the relevant doc on
[https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/)

## Defining What We Want

When deploying our own instance, we need to define what domain we want for our
user IDs and room aliases, and take care about not leaving the door open to
abusers, even in small experimental deployments.

### How Our MatrixID Will Look Like

Two very important concepts for the end-user in matrix are user IDs and room
IDs.

* A typical user ID would be `@john:example.org`. It’s made of a username
  (john) and a provider domain (example.org).
* A typical room address would be `#myroom:example.org`

Instead of example.org, we will want our own domain. In many cases, the root
domain is already used to serve a website or another service. Some people
decide to use a subdomain, like `matrix.example.org`, resulting in Matrix IDs
following the format `@john:matrix.example.org`.

While this works in practice, the `matrix.` subdomain looks redundant: we’re
already chatting on Matrix, no need to tell me the person is on Matrix. It’s
possible to keep serving Synapse on `matrix.example.org` but to still have
`@john:example.org` Matrix ID, thanks to [delegation of incoming traffic](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/develop/docs/delegate.md).

Let’s be careful nonetheless: it’s not possible to change the domain of an
instance! Once you deploy it with a domain, it’s forever. This is why we are
going to set-up delegation of incoming traffic from the beginning, even if we
don’t have anything else served on the root domain at the moment.

### Not Leaving the Door Open

When setting up a Synapse instance, leaving registrations completely open
without any sort of verification is a good way to get our server abused as a
spam vector and added to many other servers’ blocklist.

You probably either want to close registrations entirely, add email or captcha
verification, or even better: only allow registrations for email addresses
matching a certain pattern (e.g. to restrict registrations to everyone in your
organisation as long as they have a @example.org email address).

In any case, by default Synapse won’t start if you leave registrations
completely open without verification and without bypassing that security
setting. In our example we’ll close registrations entirely, and create accounts
manually.


### General Concepts

On the infrastructure level, we will need to have a machine exposed to the
Internet, and a domain name. The simplest way to get these is to rent a VPS at
a provider and buy a domain at a registrar. Renting the VPS and buying the
domain will not be covered in this tutorial. For the sake of transparency, we
used a VPS from the German provider [Netcup](https://www.netcup.eu), and bought
a domain from [Gandi](https://www.gandi.net).

We’re also going to deploy Synapse using docker containers: one for Synapse
itself, one for the database Synapse relies on, one for a web server required
to set-up delegation of incoming traffic, and one for the reverse proxy.

The reverse proxy we’re going to use is traefik. It’s the entry door for
incoming traffic on our server. We will use it to secure connections by
retrieving a certificate automatically, and to route the calls to the proper
containers.

Finally, given containers are stateless, we will need to rely on volumes to
persist the data. This is where the data and configuration files are stored.


## The Bare Minimum We Need

### A VPS with a public IP

Capacity planning is a notably difficult task when hosting a service. In the
case of Matrix, the CPU, RAM and disk space usage grows essentially with the
number of high traffic rooms your users are in.

A 100 users deployment in a closed federation can still be considered a fairly
small deployment. A five users deployment in open federation and with users in
large traffic rooms such as Matrix HQ can be more resource intensive.

We’re not going to cover how to monitor resources usage and how to scale a
deployment in this tutorial: the goal is to get a first hands-on deployment for
fun, so we’re going to deploy it on a reasonably small VPS.

### Docker and docker-compose

We assume you know what docker and docker-compose are, and that they are
installed on a fresh server. You can find the documentation for docker and
docker compose [on docker’s documentation centre](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

### A domain name

In this particular example we chose Gandi, but any registrar will do. Synapse
needs a domain name to be able to build Matrix IDs and room aliases, and you
need to be able to at least add A records (and ideally AAAA, which we’re not
going to cover in this tutorial for the sake of simplicity).

## Let’s Get Our Hands Dirty!

### The Global Architecture

![Basic architecture of Synapse deployment with docker compose](/docs/legacy/understanding-synapse-hosting-architecture.png "Basic architecture of Synapse deployment with docker compose")

### Adding DNS records

Assuming your domain name is example.org, you need to add A records to your VPS
for the following domains:

* example.org
* matrix.example.org

### docker-compose structure

A docker-compose file is used to describe what containers we want to set-up,
what volumes they are going to rely on, and how to reach each container from
the outside world.

Here is a dummy docker-compose file that only starts a nginx instance, for
reference:

```yaml
version: '3'

services:

  nginx:
    image: "nginx:1.23.1"
    restart: "always"
    volumes:
      - nginx_conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d

volumes:
  nginx_conf:
```

### Setting up a database

Let’s start by going to our home directory, and create a directory called
`infra`. In that directory, we are going to create a docker-compose.yaml file
with the following content. This will create a PostgreSQL database for our
Synapse instance.


```yaml
version: '3'

services:

  synapse_db:
    image: docker.io/postgres:14-alpine
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=synapse
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=aComplexPassphraseNobodyCanGuess
      - POSTGRES_INITDB_ARGS=--encoding=UTF-8 --lc-collate=C --lc-ctype=C
    volumes:
      - synapse_db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  synapse_db_data:
```

An important note here: storing credentials in plain text in the docker-compose
file is a bad practice. If you want to use this set-up in the longer run,
please check [docker compose and secrets](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#secrets).

We can now start the container by running `docker-compose up -d`. We can check
the container is running with docker ps:


```yaml
[root@v2202112135873173933 infra]# docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS          PORTS      NAMES
8abcc08fa546   postgres:14-alpine   "docker-entrypoint.s…"   14 seconds ago   Up 13 seconds   5432/tcp   infra-synapse_db-1
```

It may look like the database is open on the Internet… but it’s actually not.
The container is listening on port 5432 on docker’s internal network. You can
verify it’s not actually open by running `ss -tunlp`


```
[root@v2202112135873173933 infra]# ss -tunlp
Netid     State      Recv-Q     Send-Q         Local Address:Port         Peer Address:Port     Process                               
udp       UNCONN     0          0                  127.0.0.1:323               0.0.0.0:*         users:(("chronyd",pid=735,fd=5))     
udp       UNCONN     0          0                      [::1]:323                  [::]:*         users:(("chronyd",pid=735,fd=6))     
tcp       LISTEN     0          128                  0.0.0.0:22                0.0.0.0:*         users:(("sshd",pid=14338,fd=3))      
tcp       LISTEN     0          128                     [::]:22                   [::]:*         users:(("sshd",pid=14338,fd=4))
```

And now let’s check the logs by running `docker logs infra-synapse_db-1`. The
output should look like below:

```
[root@v2202112135873173933 infra]# docker logs -f infra-synapse_db-1
[…]
PostgreSQL init process complete; ready for start up.

2022-07-26 14:27:31.866 UTC [1] LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
```

We can check if the user synapse was created by trying to connect to the database. To do so, let’s get the shell inside the postgresql container by running `docker exec -it infra_synapse_db_1 /bin/bash`. We should now be able to use the built-in SQL client by running `psql -U synapse -W`. We will be prompted for our password. We need to use the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` declared in the docker-compose file. The output should look like as follows

```
bash-5.1# psql -U synapse -W Password: psql (14.4) Type "help" for help.

synapse=#
```

We can close the sql client by simultaneously pressing the Ctrl and D keys,
which will get us back to the postgresql docker container prompt. We can exit
it too by pressing Ctrl and D once again.

### Setting up Synapse

It’s now time to set up Synapse itself! First of all, we need to generate a
sample configuration file for our homeserver. To do so, let’s ask a disposable
synapse container to generate the sample configuration file for us. You only
need to edit the value of the SYNAPSE_SERVER_NAME to the value you want for the
server part of your Matrix IDs, and SYNAPSE_REPORT_STATS depending on whether
you want to report anonymous stats or not.


```
[root@v2202112135873173933 infra]# docker run -it --rm --mount type=volume,src=infra_synapse_data,dst=/data -e SYNAPSE_SERVER_NAME=example.org -e SYNAPSE_REPORT_STATS=yes matrixdotorg/synapse:v1.63.0 generate
Setting ownership on /data to 991:991
Creating log config /data/example.org.log.config
Generating config file /data/homeserver.yaml
Generating signing key file /data/example.org.signing.key
A config file has been generated in '/data/homeserver.yaml' for server name 'example.org'. Please review this file and customise it to your needs.
```

The container generated several files. The first one we’re going to have a look
at is the homeserver.yaml file, which contains all the basic information to
allow our server to run. Docker volumes data is located in
`/var/lib/docker/volumes/your_volume_name/_data`. We asked this container to
generate the files in the `infra_synapse_data` volumes. Let’s have a look at
`/var/lib/docker/volumes/infra_synapse_data/_data/homeserver.yaml `and see what
it contains:

```yaml
server_name: "example.org"
pid_file: /data/homeserver.pid
listeners:
  - port: 8008
    tls: false
    type: http
    x_forwarded: true
    resources:
      - names: [client, federation]
        compress: false
database:
  name: sqlite3
  args:
    database: /data/homeserver.db
log_config: "/data/example.org.log.config"
media_store_path: /data/media_store
registration_shared_secret: "REDACTED"
report_stats: true
macaroon_secret_key: "REDACTED"
form_secret: "REDACTED"
signing_key_path: "/data/example.org.signing.key"
trusted_key_servers:
  - server_name: "matrix.org"
```


What a pleasant surprise, it’s fairly short! Synapse indeed tries to have safe
and sane defaults, and allows administrators to add options to tweak their
configuration if they needed. The complete reference of every single option and
what they do can be found at
[https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/configuration/index.html](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/configuration/index.html)

And the good news is that we are just going to edit the database section: we’re
going to make Synapse connect to the PostgreSQL database we have set up
earlier. [According to Synapse’s documentation](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/configuration/config_documentation.html#database),
we need to edit the database section so it looks like the following instead of
the sql3 default:


```yaml
database:
  name: psycopg2
  txn_limit: 10000
  args:
    user: synapse
    password: aComplexPassphraseNobodyCanGuess
    database: synapse
    host: infra-synapse_db-1
    port: 5432
    cp_min: 5
    cp_max: 10
```


We can save the file. Let’s edit out docker-compose.yaml file to add Synapse,
and give it the volumes it needs to persist data:


```yaml
version: '3'

services:

  synapse:
    image: docker.io/matrixdotorg/synapse:v1.63.0
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - SYNAPSE_CONFIG_PATH=/data/homeserver.yaml
    volumes:
      - synapse_data:/data
    depends_on:
      - synapse_db

  synapse_db:
    image: docker.io/postgres:14-alpine
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=synapse
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=aComplexPassphraseNobodyCanGuess
      - POSTGRES_INITDB_ARGS=--encoding=UTF-8 --lc-collate=C --lc-ctype=C
    volumes:
      - synapse_db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  synapse_data:
  synapse_db_data:
```


We can now start Synapse by entering `docker compose up -d` and monitor what is
happening with `docker logs -f infra-synapse-1`. It should give us pretty
verbose output, as follows:


```
[root@v2202112135873173933 infra]# docker logs -f infra-synapse-1
Starting synapse with args -m synapse.app.homeserver --config-path /data/homeserver.yaml
This server is configured to use 'matrix.org' as its trusted key server via the
'trusted_key_servers' config option. 'matrix.org' is a good choice for a key
server since it is long-lived, stable and trusted. However, some admins may
wish to use another server for this purpose.

To suppress this warning and continue using 'matrix.org', admins should set
'suppress_key_server_warning' to 'true' in homeserver.yaml.

```

We can quit watching the logs by pressing the Ctrl and C keys simultaneously.
Voilà! We have a Synapse instance using our PostgreSQL database. Now we need to
expose it properly on the internet, and set-up the delegation of incoming
traffic.

### Serving the .well-known files

So far, we have configured our Synapse instance, but it’s not exposed on the
Internet at all. It can only be accessed from within the docker network. While
we specified the Synapse instance is going to generate Matrix IDs
with “example.org” as a server part, we won’t expose the Synapse instance on
the root domain itself. If the domain was exclusively used for Matrix that
could work. But if we want to host a website on example.org, then we need to
expose our Matrix instance somewhere else.

We are going to expose our instance on matrix.example.org. We need a way to tell
other members of the federation that even if our Matrix IDs are on example.org,
the actual technical server is on matrix.example.org: this is what delegation
of incoming traffic is for.

This can be done by serving two static files:
* example.org/.well-known/matrix/server and
* example.org/.well-known/matrix/client

One simple way to do it is to set-up a nginx homeserver and to instruct it to
serve those files directly in its configuration file. Let’s add the nginx
server in our docker-compose file:


```yaml
version: '3'

services:

  nginx:
    image: "nginx:1.22.0"
    restart: "always"
    volumes:
      - nginx_conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d

  synapse:
    image: docker.io/matrixdotorg/synapse:v1.63.0
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - SYNAPSE_CONFIG_PATH=/data/homeserver.yaml
    volumes:
      - synapse_data:/data
    depends_on:
      - synapse_db

  synapse_db:
    image: docker.io/postgres:14-alpine
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=synapse
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=aComplexPassphraseNobodyCanGuess
      - POSTGRES_INITDB_ARGS=--encoding=UTF-8 --lc-collate=C --lc-ctype=C
    volumes:
      - synapse_db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  nginx_conf:
  synapse_data:
  synapse_db_data:
```


We can then start the container for it to populate the `nginx_conf` volume with
`docker compose up -d`

Let’s now edit the /var/lib/docker/volumes/infra_nginx_conf/_data/default.conf
file, to add the following at the bottom of the file right before the closing
`}`:


```
    location /.well-known/matrix/server {
        access_log off;
        add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin *;
        default_type application/json;
        return 200 '{"m.server": "matrix.example.org:443"}';
    }

    location /.well-known/matrix/client {
        access_log off;
        add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin *;
        default_type application/json;
        return 200 '{"m.homeserver": {"base_url": "https://matrix.example.org"}}';
    }
```

We can now restart the nginx container with docker restart infra-nginx-1. Given
the server is not exposed outside of the docker network, we need to get a
prompt inside the container to check the files are properly served. We can get
it with `docker exec -it infra-nginx-1 /bin/bash`

Once inside the container, we can use curl to ask for these files:

```
root@66a61467b9ba:/# curl -X GET "http://localhost/.well-known/matrix/server"
{"m.server": "matrix.example.org:443"}
root@66a61467b9ba:/# curl -X GET "http://localhost/.well-known/matrix/client"
{"m.homeserver":{"base_url": "https://matrix.example.org"}}
```

We can now exit the container prompt by pressing the Ctrl and D keys
simultaneously.

### Exposing on the Internet with a Reverse Proxy

Everything is in place, now we only have to expose the relevant bits of our
infrastructure on the Internet! This mainly means the nginx server, and the
Synapse instance. Of course, we want to keep our database private and only
accessible by containers within the docker network.

To do so we’re going to rely on traefik, which adds a lot of sugar when it comes
to routing external calls to the right containers. Traefik also handles the
Let’s Encrypt certificates management to make sure the traffic remains
encrypted and that our certificates never expire.

The first thing we need to do is to add a traefik container in our
docker-compose file, to map the docker socket to the traefik container so it
can do its magic, and to give it a volume so it can store the certificates and
associated keypairs. Our docker-compose file should look like below. Make sure
to update the `certificatesresolvers.letls.acme.email` label to an email
address where you can be reached out to.


```yaml
version: '3'

services:

  traefik:
    image: "traefik"
    restart: "always"
    command:
      - "--api=true"
      - "--providers.docker=true"
      - "--providers.docker.exposedbydefault=false"
      - "--entrypoints.web.address=:80"
      - "--entrypoints.websecure.address=:443"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.letls.acme.email=admin@example.org"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.letls.acme.storage=/certs/acme.json"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.letls.acme.httpchallenge=true"
      - "--certificatesresolvers.letls.acme.httpchallenge.entrypoint=web"
    ports:
      - "443:443"
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro"
      - "traefik_certs:/certs"

  nginx:
    image: "nginx:1.22.0"
    restart: "always"
    volumes:
      - nginx_conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d

  synapse:
    image: docker.io/matrixdotorg/synapse:v1.63.0
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - SYNAPSE_CONFIG_PATH=/data/homeserver.yaml
    volumes:
      - synapse_data:/data
    depends_on:
      - synapse_db

  synapse_db:
    image: docker.io/postgres:14-alpine
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=synapse
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=aComplexPassphraseNobodyCanGuess
      - POSTGRES_INITDB_ARGS=--encoding=UTF-8 --lc-collate=C --lc-ctype=C
    volumes:
      - synapse_db_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  traefik_certs:
  nginx_conf:
  synapse_data:
  synapse_db_data:
```


Now let’s check traefik is actually listening to the outside world with
`ss -tunlp`:


```
[root@v2202112135873173933 infra]# ss -tunlp

Fantastic! But that’s only the first step: traefik does listen to the outside
world, but it doesn’t know where to route calls yet. For that we’re going to
rely on labels. Let’s start with something straightforward: we’re going to
route all the calls to our root domain example.org to the nginx container
serving the `.well-known` files.

The nginx section of our docker-compose file should look like below. Of course,
adapt the labels to your own domain.


```yaml
  nginx:
    image: "nginx:1.22.0"
    restart: "always"
    volumes:
      - nginx_conf:/etc/nginx/conf.d
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.nginx.entrypoints=websecure"
      - "traefik.http.routers.nginx.rule=Host(`example.org`)"
      - "traefik.http.routers.nginx.tls=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.nginx.tls.certresolver=letls"
```


We can then restart containers with `docker compose up -d`. Traefik might need a
few minutes to retrieve the certificates, but you should now be able to reach
[https://example.org/.well-known/matrix/server](https://example.org/.well-known/matrix/server) and
[https://example.org/.well-known/matrix/client](https://example.org/.well-known/matrix/client) from your browser! Wee!

Let’s now expose Synapse on its technical URL as well by adding some labels in
the docker-compose file. The synapse section should look like below. Of course,
here again adapt the labels to your own domain.

```yaml
  synapse:
    image: docker.io/matrixdotorg/synapse:v1.63.0
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - SYNAPSE_CONFIG_PATH=/data/homeserver.yaml
    volumes:
      - synapse_data:/data
    depends_on:
      - synapse_db
    labels:
      - traefik.enable=true
      - traefik.http.routers.synapse.entrypoints=websecure
      - traefik.http.routers.synapse.rule=Host(`matrix.example.org`)
      - traefik.http.routers.synapse.tls=true
      - traefik.http.routers.synapse.tls.certresolver=letls
```

We can try to reach https://matrix.example.org… and it should answer!

### Creating an account, and logging in

It looks like our server is online, that’s fantastic! Let’s connect to our new
Matrix account then! But wait… registrations are closed by default on Synapse.
We can’t register using a web client. Let’s get a prompt in the Synapse
container with `docker exec -it infra-synapse-1 /bin/bash` to manually register
a new user using the `register_new_matrix_user -c /data/homeserver.yaml
http://localhost:8008` command:


```
root@e752d46bc5f2:/# register_new_matrix_user -c /data/homeserver.yaml http://localhost:8008
New user localpart [root]: myuserid 
Password: 
Confirm password: 
Make admin [no]: 
Sending registration request...
Success!
```

Voilà! We can now head to [https://app.element.io](https://app.element.io), select our example.org domain instead of matrix.org,
and log in with this new account! Congratulations, you set-up your own
homeserver the hard way!
