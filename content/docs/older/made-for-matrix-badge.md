## Preferred Badge

![made for matrix](/docs/legacy/made-for-matrix.png)

Use the preferred black badge in your marketing materials. When using the badge
on your website, link the badge to https://matrix.org using the
`target="_blank"` attribute.

## Inverted Badge

![made for matrix](/docs/legacy/made-for-matrix-inverted.png)

If the preferred black badge isn't legible in your layout, for example because
your background is too dark, instead use the inverted badge, displayed above on
a grey background.

## Graphic Standards

![made for matrix](/docs/legacy/made-for-matrix-standards.png)

Minimum clear space is equal to one-quarter the height of the badge. Don't place
photos, typography, or other graphic elements inside the minimum clear space.
Do not stretch or alter the aspect ratio of the badge.
