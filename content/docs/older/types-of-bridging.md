Bridges come in many flavours, and we need consistent terminology within the
Matrix community to ensure everyone (users, developers, core team) is on the
same page.  This post is primarily intended for bridge developers to refer to
when building bridges.

## Types of rooms

### Portal rooms

Bridges can register themselves as controlling chunks of room aliases namespace,
letting Matrix users join remote rooms transparently if they
`/join #_oftc_#wherever:matrix.org` or similar.  The resulting Matrix room
is typically automatically bridged to the single target remote room. Access
control for Matrix users is typically managed by the remote network’s side of
the room. This is called a portal room, and is useful for jumping into remote
rooms without any configuration needed whatsoever - using Matrix as a ‘bouncer’
for the remote network.

### Plumbed rooms

Alternatively, an existing Matrix room can be can plumbed into one or more
specific remote rooms by configuring a bridge (which can be run by anyone). For
instance, #matrix:matrix.org is plumbed into #matrix on Libera Chat,
matrixdotorg/#matrix on Slack, etc.  Access control for Matrix users is
necessarily managed by the Matrix side of the room. This is useful for using
Matrix to link together different communities.

Migrating rooms between a portal & plumbed room is currently a bit of a mess, as
there’s not yet a way for users to remove portal rooms once they’re created, so
you can end up with a mix of portal & plumbed users bridged into a room, which
looks weird from both the Matrix and non-Matrix viewpoints.
https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/387 tracks this.

## Types of bridges (simplest first):

### Bridgebot-based bridges

The simplest way to exchange messages with a remote network is to have the
bridge log into the network using one or more predefined users called bridge
bots - typically called MatrixBridge or MatrixBridge[123] etc.  These relay
traffic on behalf of the users on the other side, but it’s a terrible
experience as all the metadata about the messages and senders is lost.  This is
how the [telematrix]
(https://github.com/SijmenSchoon/telematrix) matrix<->telegram bridge currently
works.

### Bot-API (aka Virtual user) based bridges

Some remote systems support the idea of injecting messages from ‘fake’
or ‘virtual’ users, which can be used to represent the Matrix-side users as
unique entities in the remote network.  For instance, Slack’s inbound webhooks
lets remote bots be created on demand, letting Matrix users be shown
cosmetically correctly in the timeline as virtual users.  However, the
resulting virtual users aren’t real users on the remote system, so don’t have
presence/profile and can’t be tab-completed or direct-messaged etc.  They also
have no way to receive typing notifs or other richer info which may not be
available via bot APIs.  This is how the current [matrix-appservice-slack]
(https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack) bridge works.

### Simple puppeted bridge

This is a richer form of bridging, where the bridge logs into the remote service
as if it were a real 3rd party client for that service.  As a result, the
Matrix user has to already have a valid account on the remote system.  In
exchange, the Matrix user ‘puppets’ their remote user, such that other users on
the remote system aren’t even aware they are speaking to a user via Matrix. The
full semantics of the remote system are available to the bridge to expose into
Matrix.  However, the bridge has to handle the authentication process to log
the user into the remote bridge.

This is essentially how the current [matrix-appservice-irc
](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc) bridge works (if you
configure it to log into the remote IRC network as your ‘real’ IRC nickname).
[matrix-appservice-gitter
](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-gitter) is being extended to
support both puppeted and bridgebot-based operation. It’s how the experimental
[matrix-appservice-tg](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-tg) bridge works.

Going forwards we’re aiming for all bridges to be at least simple puppeted, if
not double-puppeted.

### Double-puppeted bridge

A simple ‘puppeted bridge’ allows the Matrix user to control their account on
their remote network. However, ideally this puppeting should work in both
directions, so if the user logs into (say) their native telegram client and
starts conversations, sends messages etc, these should be reflected back into
Matrix as if the user had done them there. This requires the bridge to be able
to puppet the Matrix side of the bridge on behalf of the user.

This is the holy-grail of bridging because both the Matrix account and the third
party account are accurately represented on their respective networks, with all
user metadata intact. This is in contrast to a relaybot which would appear as a
separate user from whom it represents.

Several obstacles exist to the proper implementation of double-puppeted bridges.
On the Matrix side, we need an elegant way of having the bridge auth with
Matrix as the matrix user (which requires some kind of scoped access_token
delegation). On the third-party network, unique problems exist depending on the
limitations of that particular network network. For example, many third party
networks will lack the ability to represent other Matrix users than the one
being puppeted (see hybrid relaybot).

[matrix-puppet-bridge](https://github.com/matrix-hacks/matrix-puppet-bridge) is
a community project that tries to facilitate development of double-puppeted
bridges, having done so, without a bridgebot feature, for [several networks
](https://github.com/matrix-hacks/matrix-puppet-bridge#examples). A downside to
their approach is the assumption that an individual will run the bridge on
their own homeserver, thus working around the problem of sharing auth
credentials on a shared homeserver.

### Hybrid Relaybot Puppet Bridge

This type of bridge is a combination single or double puppet bridge which tries
to solve the problem of representing other users by means of the bridgebot
technique. [mautrix/telegram](https://github.com/mautrix/telegram) works in
this way.

### Server-to-server bridging

Some remote protocols (IRC, XMPP, SIP, SMTP, NNTP, GnuSocial etc) support
federation - either open or closed.  The most elegant way of bridging to these
protocols would be to have the bridge participate in the federation as a
server, directly bridging the entire namespace into Matrix.

We’re not aware of anyone who’s done this yet.

### One-way bridging

One-way bridging is rare, but can be used to represent a bridge that is bridging
from the remote system into matrix. This is common when the remote system does
not permit message posting, or is simply not capable of handling posting
outside their system. The users bridged from the remote system often appear as
virtual users in matrix, as is the case with [matrix-appservice-instagram
](https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-appservice-instagram).

### Sidecar bridge

Finally: the types of bridging described above assume that you are synchronising
the conversation history of the remote system into Matrix, so it may be
decentralised and exposed to multiple users within the wider Matrix network.

This can cause problems where the remote system may have arbitrarily complicated
permissions (ACLs) controlling access to the history, which will then need to
be correctly synchronised with Matrix’s ACL model, without introducing security
issues such as races.  We already see some problems with this on the IRC
bridge, where history visibility for +i and +k channels have to be carefully
synchronised with the Matrix rooms.

You can also hit problems with other network-specific features not yet having
equivalent representation in the Matrix protocol (e.g. ephemeral messages, or
op-only messages - although arguably that’s a type of ACL).

One solution could be to support an entirely different architecture of bridging,
where the Matrix client-server API is mapped directly to the remote service,
meaning that ACL decisions are delegated to the remote service, and
conversations are not exposed into the wider Matrix. This is effectively using
the bridge purely as a 3rd party client for the network (similar to Bitlbee).
The bridge is only available to a single user, and conversations cannot be
shared with other Matrix users as they aren’t actually Matrix rooms.
(Another solution could be to use Active Policy Servers at last as a way of
centralising and delegating ACLs for a room)

This is essentially an entirely different product to the rest of Matrix, and
whilst it could be a solution for some particularly painful ACL problems, we’re
focusing on non-sidecar bridges for now.
