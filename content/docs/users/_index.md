## Matrix for Instant Messaging

Matrix works a little like email, but instantaneous and secure:
- You need to register an account at a provider
- Whatever your provider is, you can talk to people using other providers
- In the same way you can use Outlook or Thunderbird with the same email
  account, you can use different Matrix apps for the same Matrix account.

Several apps exist, but we're going to go with Element for the sake of
simplicity, as it's among the most advanced apps on the market.

Once you are more comfortable with the basics and if you want to use another
app, head to the [clients](/ecosystem/clients) section of this website.

## Creating a Matrix account

You can use any provider you want. The experts can even set-up their own
provider, but it's not a requirement at all.

The Matrix.org Foundation maintains a public provider everybody can register
an account on for free. For your first steps, the simplest is to register an
account there.

To register an account, you need to use an app.
