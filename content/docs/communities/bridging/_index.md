The easiest way to bridge your Matrix community with you Discord one is to rely
on the free Discord bridge [provided by t2bot.io](https://t2bot.io/discord/).

It contains all the instructions about how to bridge your Discord channels with
your Matrix rooms. Please refer to their documentation directly.

Here you can see a bridged room from the Matrix and the Discord perspective.

If you're interested in self-hosting your bridge or discovering all the Discord
bridge implementations, please head to the [Ecosystem > Bridges](/ecosystem/bridges)
section of this website.
