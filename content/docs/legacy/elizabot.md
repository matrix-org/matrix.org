In this article, we'll use Matrix, a Raspberry Pi and JavaScript to bring back
chatbot software from the 1960s: ELIZA.

## What is ELIZA?

ELIZA is a computer program written between 1964 and 1966, which imitates the
conversation style of a psychotherapist of the era. It behaves like what we
would now call a *chatbot*, but there was no such concept at the time - in fact
there were only the first glimpses of text chat as we would recognise it today.

The original program was designed and at the MIT Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory by Joseph Weizenbaum. ELIZA was first implemented on the IBM 7094
and written in MAD-SLIP, where
[MAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAD_(programming_language)) was a popular
programming system for IBM mainframes of the time, and
[SLIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLIP_(programming_language)) was a
list-processing extension of Weizenbaum's own creation.

Seeing the results, in which users were highly willing to interact with ELIZA,
Weizenbaum was disturbed by just how effective the apparently simple bot was. He
was motivated to write a book explaining the way people tend to anthropomorphise
technology by applying their own experiences to their usage.

## 2005, online JavaScript version appeared

In 2005, [Norbert Landsteiner](https://twitter.com/mass_werk) created a
JavaScript program which he made available as *elizabot.js*, and made ELIZA
available online through a web interface: <https://www.masswerk.at/elizabot/>.

Now we'll make this available on Matrix.

## Making the bot

### Using the library

For this project I have chosen to use an adaptation of the elizabot.js library:
[eliza-as-promised](https://github.com/natelewis/eliza-as-promised), which
exposes the bot as a promise-based node.js module. This module makes working
with ELIZA very simple. First we create an instance of the bot object:

```javascript
const Eliza = require('eliza-as-promised');
var eliza = new Eliza();
```

We can get an initial greeting as follows:

```javascript
console.log(eliza.getInitial());
```

The `getResponse()` function takes a string from the user, and returns a
`Promise` with a response, with either a `reply` or `final` field. If the
response is a reply, we can give another string to get a response, if the
response is final, the session is over. For example:

```javascript
eliza.getResponse("Help me Eliza!")
.then((response) => {
    if (response.reply) {
        console.log(response.reply);
    }
    if (response.final) {
        console.log(response.final);
        process.exit(0);
    }
});
```

### Using Matrix to make a modern Chatbot

Matrix is an open standard for real-time communication over IP. It is often used
to enable Instant Messaging. Matrix is not just  Open Source, it is also
designed to be interoperable, which makes it easy to take existing projects and
integrate them.

Matrix provides a decentralised architecture, in which servers connect to one
another, but as a user your client connects to a single homeserver, as described
in the diagram below.

![Matrix Design](/docs/legacy/matrix-diagram.png)

However, for this project we only need to look at the Client-Server API, which
is the way in which clients and servers communicate with one another. To make it
easier to connect the ELIZA library to Matrix, I chose to use a JavaScript
library designed to access the Matrix Client-Server API: [matrix-bot-sdk]
from [TravisR].

### Code Walkthrough

First, we'll need a new instance of the Bot SDK, which we can obtain from NPM as
follows:

```
npm install matrix-bot-sdk
```

Then, in our application code, we will instantiate and start a new client. Note
that you can obtain an access token for the bot [using
Element](https://t2bot.io/docs/access_tokens/).

```javascript
var access_token = "...";
const MatrixClient = require("matrix-bot-sdk").MatrixClient;
const AutojoinRoomsMixin = require("matrix-bot-sdk").AutojoinRoomsMixin;
const client = new MatrixClient("https://matrix.org", access_token);
AutojoinRoomsMixin.setupOnClient(client);
client.start().then(() => console.log("Client started!"));
```

I also added the AutojoinRoomsMixin at this point, which instructs the bot to
accept any room invitation it receives.

Knowing that we can use
[`eliza-as-promised`](https://github.com/natelewis/eliza-as-promised) to create
new instances of Eliza, let's start by doing so whenever the bot joins a new
room.

```javascript
var elizas = {};
client.on("room.join", (roomId) => {
    elizas[roomId] = {
        eliza: new Eliza(),
        last: (new Date()).getTime()
    }
    client.sendMessage(roomId, {
        "msgtype": "m.notice",
        "body": elizas[roomId].eliza.getInitial()
    });
});
```

What's happening here? First we make a new object to contain a mapping of room
IDs to `Eliza` objects. When we get a room join event, we assign a new `Eliza`
object and the current time to the room ID. Next, we use the newly created
object to send the initial greeting to the room, using the same call to
`getInitial()` we used earlier.

Next, we'll accept messages from the user and provide a response:

```javascript
client.on("room.message", async function (roomId, event)  {
    if (event["sender"] === await client.getUserId()) return;
    if (! event.content || ! event.content.body) return;

    elizas[roomId].eliza.getResponse(event.content.body)
        .then((response) => {
            var responseText = '';
            if (response.reply) { responseText = response.reply; }
            if (response.final) { responseText = response.final; }

            client.sendMessage(roomId, {
                "msgtype": "m.notice",
                "body": responseText,
                "responds": {
                    "sender": event.sender,
                    "message": event.content.body
                }
            }).then((eventId) => {
                if (response.final) {
                    client.leaveRoom(roomId);
                }
            });
    });
});
```

It looks like a lot of code, but in fact we can break down what is happening
here quite simply.

1. When an event is received in a room, we react to the event with a function
   that takes the `roomId` and `event` received as parameters.
2. If the user is our own, or the event does not contain a body, we must
   return.
3. We use the `roomId` to access the specific `Eliza` instance, as previously
   created.
4. As above, we call `getResponse()` on the Eliza object, and we pass the
   message string we just received.
5. We handle the promise returned by `getResponse()` by extracting the response
   string into `responseText`, and use that string as a message to send back
   into the room as a response.
6. Finally, if the response text we took from our Eliza is "final", we have
   Eliza leave the room. (The bot can always be re-invited!)

That all the code needed to get a working version of the bot running. If you
look at <https://github.com/benparsons/elizabot>, you can find a simple
implementation as described here in `simple.js`, and a more robust
implementation in `index.js`.

## Deploying on a Raspberry Pi

To run the bot, we simply run `node index.js`. However, part of this project is
to get the bot running on a Raspberry Pi - and for convenience the way to do
this is to have it run as soon as the device boots. Luckily, there are standard
ways of achieving this, one of which is to use `systemd`. [Open a shell on your
Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/terminal/) (possibly using a
graphical desktop if one is installed, or using ssh) and enter this command to
access the correct directory:

```
cd /etc/systemd/system
```

Now, we'll use vim to create a file describing the service we want to create:

```
vim elizabot.service
```

Finally, enter the following text (you may need to change paths depending on
where your script is located):

```
[Unit]
Description=Elizabot
After=multi-user.target

[Service]
Type=idle
ExecStart=/usr/bin/node /home/pi/elizabot/index.js > /home/pi/elizabot/log.log 2>&1

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

... and run the following to enable the service:

```
sudo systemctl enable elizabot.service
```

Now, whenever you plug in your Pi, your bot will be launched and ready to go. Of
course, it is quite possible to run this software on a server, but having a
separate box makes it more fun. The physicality of a Raspberry Pi means it gets
more attention and understanding from people who see it.
