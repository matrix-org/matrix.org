This guide assists developers of API clients that target the `v1` version of the
API to migrate their code to the later `r0`. It does not aim to introduce new
concepts that were added in `r0` except where these replace things that were
removed since `v1`.

## Updated Version In Path

The new version of the API is `r0`; this should be used in paths where `v1` used
to appear. Additionally, the `/api` path component has now been removed. API
endpoint paths are now:

```
POST /_matrix/client/r0/register
GET /_matrix/client/r0/login
```

etc...

## New Registration and Login Endpoints

The `r0` version of the `/register` and `/login` endpoints is different to the
`v1` version. See the updated API documentation for details on how the new API
works. In brief, the changes are that the new version returns extra information
in the form of the `params` object, and that a sequence of multiple calls may
be statefully chained together by the `session` parameter.

Additionally, whereas in `v1` the client performed a `GET` request to discover
the list of supported flows for `/register`, in `r0` this is done by sending a
`POST` request with an empty data body. The `/login` endpoint continues to use
the `GET` method as before.

## Deprecated Endpoints

The following endpoints are now deprecated and replaced by the `/sync` API:

```
/initialSync
/events
/rooms/:roomId/initialSync
```

The new `/sync` API takes an optional `since` parameter to distinguish the
initial sync from subsequent updates for more events.

The return value takes a different structure to that from the previous
`/initialSync` API. For full details see the API documentation, but the
following summary may be useful to compare with `v1`:

> -   `/initialSync` returned a `state` key containing the most recent
>     state in the room, whereas the new `/sync` API's `state`
>     corresponds to the room state at the start of the returned
>     timeline. This makes it easier for clients to represent state
>     changes that occur within the region of returned timeline.
> -   In `/events`, if more events occurred since the `since` token than
>     the `limit` parameter allowed, then events from the start of this
>     range were returned and the client had to perform another fetch to
>     incrementally obtain more of them. In the `/sync` API the result
>     always contains the most recent events, creating a gap if this
>     would be more events than the requested limit. If this occurs then
>     the client can use the `prev_batch` token as a reference to
>     obtaining more.
> -   The `state` contained in the response to a `/sync` request that
>     has a `since` parameter will contain only keys that have changed
>     since the basis given in the `since` parameter, rather than
>     containing a full set values.

The `/initialSync` API allowed a parameter called `limit` to limit the number of
events returned. To apply this limit to the new `/sync` API, you can supply an
ad-hoc filter:

```
GET .../sync?filter={"room":{"timeline":{"limit:$limit}}}
```

There is no direct replacement for the per-room `/rooms/:roomId/initialSync`
endpoint, but the behaviour can be recreated by applying an ad-hoc filter using
the `filter` parameter to `/sync` that selects only the required room ID:

```
GET .../sync?filter={"room":{"rooms":[$room_id]}}
```

However, the way that the new `/sync` API works should remove any need to do
this kind of query, in the situations where the `v1` API needed it.
Specifically, on joining a new room the initial information about that room is
sent in the next `/sync` batch, so it should not be necessary to query that one
room specially.

The following endpoint is deprecated and has no direct replacement:

```
/events/:eventId
```

However, if the client knows the room ID of the room that the event is in, it
can use the `/rooms/:roomId/context/:eventId` request to fetch the event
itself. By giving the `limit` parameter of `0` the client can save using extra
bandwidth by actually returning additional context events around the requested
one.

## Removed POST Endpoint

The room message sending API endpoint in `v1` accepted both `PUT` and `POST`
methods, where the client could specify a message ID in the `PUT` path for
de-duplication purposes, or have the server allocate one during `POST`. In `r0`
this latter form no longer exists. Clients will now have to generate these IDs
locally.

The following URLs have therefore been removed:

```
POST .../rooms/:roomId/send/:messageType
```
