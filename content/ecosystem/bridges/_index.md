Bridges allow you to connect Matrix to a third-party platform, and interact

An important idea in Matrix is Interoperability. This means that Matrix is open
to exchanging data and messages with other platforms using an
[Open Standard](https://matrix.org/docs/spec). We refer to the connection to
other platforms as bridging. Click on the platform you would like to bridge to
to see all the existing bridges.
