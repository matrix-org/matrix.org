A simple bridge between Matrix and Discord written in Python.

It contains two bridges:

A puppeting appservice: The puppeting bridge written with minimal dependencies.
Running this requires a self-hosted homeserver.

A non-puppeting bridge: The non-puppeting plaintext bridge written with
matrix-nio and discord.py, most people would want to use this one if running on
heroku or similar and don't have their own server. **NOTE: This is unmaintained
and might break in the future due to Discord changes.**
