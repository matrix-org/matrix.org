To participate in the Matrix ecosystem you need a Matrix account. Such accounts
are provided by homeservers, sometimes simply called servers. This section lists
all the server software account providers can run.

Note: you don't need to run your homeserver yourself to participate in the
Matrix ecosystem. If you are not a tech-savvy person or are not interested into
running your own homeserver, head to the [user documentation](/docs/users/) to
discover how to chat using Matrix.
