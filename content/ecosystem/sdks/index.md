SDKs are pieces of software meant for developers, that take care of the
technical Matrix protocol calls behind the scenes. They allow them to focus on
where they can add the most value. If you're not a developer, this section of
the website is probably not for you.

There are two fundamental types of SDKs: clients and appservices. This
distinction is quite academical, and we went for a more pragmatic approach. You
will find below SDKs by type of product you may want to create (namely: clients,
bots, bridges). Don't be surprised if a same SDK appears in several sections!

If you are a developer and are not sure what the difference between clients and
appservices, please head to [the developers documentation](/docs/matrix-concepts/).
