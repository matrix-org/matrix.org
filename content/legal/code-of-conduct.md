This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the Matrix community, as well as steps for reporting unacceptable behaviour. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all, and expect our code of conduct to be honoured. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned from the community.

This applies to conversation in the any room in the Matrix Space ([#team:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#team:matrix.org)) and commits and comments relating to any project in the [matrix-org](https://github.com/matrix-org) Github space.
 
Our open source community strives to:

* **Be friendly and patient.**
* **Be welcoming**: We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
* **Be considerate**: Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else's primary language.
* **Be respectful**:  Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behaviour and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
* **Be careful in the words that we choose**: Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behaviour aren't acceptable.
* **Try to understand why we disagree**: Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we're different. The strength of our community comes from its diversity, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong. Don't forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn't get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.

- Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others

- Deliberate "outing" of any aspect of a person's identity without their consent except as necessary to protect others from intentional abuse
- Publication of non-harassing private communication

We will not act on complaints regarding:

- Good faith and non-malicious conduct whose object is to ameliorate the conditions of disadvantaged individuals or groups including those that are disadvantaged because of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.
- Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as "leave me alone," "go away," or "I'm not discussing this with you"
- Refusal to explain or debate social justice concepts
- Communicating in a 'tone' you don't find congenial
- Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behaviour or assumptions

### Diversity Statement

We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community for all. Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do our best to right the wrong.

Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honour diversity in age, gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and technical ability. We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the protected
characteristics above, including participants with disabilities.

### Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour — or have any other concerns — please report it by contacting us via abuse@matrix.org. All reports will be handled with discretion. In your report please include:

- Your contact information.
- Names (usernames and nicks, real names, and/or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there are additional witnesses, please
include them as well. Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. 
- The date and time of the incident (or start of incident).
- Any additional information that may be helpful.

After filing a report you will receive an automated response confirming delivery of your report. Typically, we do not answer abuse reports unless we require further clarification.

If the person who is harassing you is part of the response team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. If the complaint originates from a member of the response team, it will be handled by a different member of the response team. We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.

You are also able to report abusive content via your chosen Matrix client, by clicking the event in question and selecting report. Please note these reports go to your homeserver administrator.

We use [Mjolnir](https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir) to handle the moderation of rooms under this Code of Conduct, via the bot @abuse:matrix.org. Please note that pinging this account, or any other staff accounts, is not the appropriate reporting mechanism. Repeated in-room reports might result in moderation action.
