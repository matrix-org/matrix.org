title = "Matrix.org Homeserver Terms and Conditions"
+++

Please read this document carefully before accessing or using this service.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 English, not Legalese

Most Terms of Use and Privacy Policy documents are unreadable. They are written by lawyers and for lawyers, and in our
opinion are not very effective.

We decided to use plain English as much as possible, to make our terms as clear as possible. We are always looking to
improve, so please send us feedback on this document to <legal@matrix.org>.

When you read 'the Matrix.org homeserver' or 'the Service' below, it refers to the services made available
at **Matrix.org** which store your account and personal conversation history, provide services such as bots and bridges,
and communicate via the open Matrix decentralised communication protocol with the public Matrix Network.

Where you read The Matrix.org Foundation C.I.C., The Matrix.org Foundation, The Matrix Foundation, or The Foundation,
it refers to the Community Interest Company incorporated on 29 October 2018 to be the neutral custodian of the
Matrix protocol: The Matrix.org Foundation C.I.C., and their agents.

Where you read 'Element' below, it refers to Element, a trading name of New Vector Ltd., its French subsidiary:
Element Software SARL, its U.S. subsidiary: Element Software Inc, its German subsidiary:
Element Software GmbH, and their agents. Element is contracted by the Foundation to provide some Services on its behalf,
such as the hosting, maintenance and monitoring of the Matrix.org homeserver.

If this agreement is not acceptable, please use a Matrix server provided by someone else.

Contact Information:

Email: [support@matrix.org](mailto:support@matrix.org)

Postal address:

Matrix.org Foundation
10 Queen Street Place
London
United Kingdom
EC4R 1AG

Should you have other questions or concerns about this document, please send us an email at [legal@matrix.org](mailto:legal@matrix.org).

### 1.2 Using The Service Means Accepting These Terms

By accessing or using the Service in any way, whether you have created a Matrix account on the Matrix.org homeserver,
or whether you are accessing content federated from the Matrix.org homeserver to another Matrix homeserver,
or are just browsing rooms as an unauthenticated guest,
you agree to and are bound by the terms and conditions written in this document.

If you do not agree to all of the terms and conditions contained in this document,
please use a Matrix server provided by someone else and refrain from accessing content federated from this server.

### 1.3 This is a living document

This is a living document. With your help, we want to make it the best in the industry.

If you read something that rubs you the wrong way, or if you think of something that should be added,
please get in touch! We're all ears! Email [legal@matrix.org](mailto:legal:matrix.org) and we'll chat.

We don't amend this document for any specific users or use case,
but if your proposed changes apply to all of our users, we'll be happy to update it for everyone.
Scroll to the bottom to see the history so far.

We will likely improve this document over time. By continuing to use the Service,
you will implicitly accept the changes we make.

Your access and use of the Service is always subject to the most current version of this document.

### 1.4 Breach of Terms

If you breach any of the terms and conditions in this document,
your authorisation to access or use the Service automatically terminates.

We may block, restrict, disable, suspend or terminate your access to all or part of the Service
at any time in our sole discretion, without prior notice or liability to you.

If you think we removed your access by mistake, send an email to [abuse@matrix.org](mailto:abuse@matrix.org)
and we'll give you our reasoning, when possible.

## 2. Support

Support for the Matrix.org homeserver is provided on a best effort basis by Element - however,
support is often available from the wider Matrix Community in the public Matrix Support rooms.

Queries sent to [support@matrix.org](mailto:support@matrix.org) will be addressed on a best-effort basis
by the paid team. Phone support is not provided.

We love Matrix and will support our users as much as we can, but we are also a small team
and value our work/life balance. This means that although we'll try our best, we do not provide 24/7 support.

## 3. Intellectual Property Rights

### 3.1 Who owns the IP of my messages and files?

We do not claim intellectual property rights over rooms, message content or files uploaded to the Service.

You acknowledge and agree that we have no liability of any kind should anyone you granted
access to your messages or files modify, destroy, corrupt, copy or distribute them,
or violate the terms of use or other limitations that you may impose on the use of your shared content.

We may pre-screen user messages or files to prevent spam and other abuse,
and we may remove any messages or files (including entire rooms) from the Matrix.org homeserver
for any reason without notice at our sole discretion.
By posting or uploading your messages or files, you represent and warrant that you own
or otherwise control all of the intellectual property rights and other rights to your user
materials as described in these Terms of Use, including all the rights necessary for you
to post or upload said messages or files.

You are solely and entirely responsible for all of your messages and files that you post
or otherwise submit via the Service.
You shall assume all risks associated with the use of said content including any reliance on the accuracy,
completeness or usefulness. The Foundation does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of your messages or files.

For further details on our approach to IP and copyright, please refer to our [copyright notice](https://matrix.org/legal/copyright-notice).

## 4. Reliability

### 4.1 Do you guarantee that the Service will be accessible at all Times?

In short, we do not. Like all other cloud-based applications,
we are vulnerable to the inherent unreliability of the Internet.
We do not offer contracted SLA for availability of the Service and your data.

We monitor the Service closely and have set up automated alarms to be notified (via email,
push notifications and phone calls) when the Matrix.org homeserver is under stress,
so that we can deal with the issue before it becomes a problem that might impact customer access.

You acknowledge and agree that the Foundation,
shall not be liable for any failure to store your materials on the Matrix.org homeserver at any time.

## 5. App Developers

We encourage you to write software that uses the Matrix Protocol and interfaces with the Service.

The Matrix Protocol and our implementation will change over time,
and we may change or deprecate APIs or behaviour for any feature of the Service from time to time -
it is your responsibility to ensure that calls or requests you make to or via our Service are
compatible with then-current APIs for the Service. We will always try to inform you of any changes
with reasonable notice so you can adjust your Application, but we are under no obligation to do so.

Provided that you comply with the terms of this Agreement and our policies and procedures,
you may use the Service to execute Applications owned by you.
You are solely responsible for your Applications, including any data, text, images or content they contain.

The Services may allow you to encrypt your communications end-to-end between devices.
There may be restrictions and limitations on the import, possession, use,
transfer and/or export of strong encryption technology under the laws of the country in which you intend to use the Service.
It is your sole obligation and responsibility to check such restrictions and limitations before using the Service and
to comply with them. We reserve the right to suspend the Service immediately and without notice if we determine,
in our sole judgment, that the Service is being used in violation of local regulations governing
the use of cryptographic technologies (even though we have no responsibility to make such determination).

## 9. Links to third party sites

The Service may include links that will take you to other sites outside of the Service.
The linked sites are provided as a convenience and the inclusion of the links
do not imply any endorsement by us of any linked site.
We have no control of the linked sites and you therefore acknowledge and
agree that we are not responsible for the contents of any linked site,
any link contained in a linked site or any changes or updates to a linked site.
You further acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for
any form of transmission (e.g. webcasting) received from any linked site.

other similar software code that is downloaded to your computer from the site or

account with respect to the site or any services or materials, either with or without your knowledge.

Some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or

other partners and employees harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys' fees,

   content (e.g. reliance on the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of your user materials);

as reflected by that provision, and the remainder of the Terms of Use shall continue in full force and effect.

**A note to other startups:** this document was heavily inspired by
[Balsamiq's plain English ToS document](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/tos/).
We were impressed by their championing of plain English,
and wanted to reproduce that as much as possible in our own legal documentation.
Feel free to draw similar inspiration from this document,
though be sure to get any documents you produce checked over by a lawyer. Good luck!
