The published room directory of a Matrix homeserver is a great way to discover rooms and spaces. It’s often the starting point for new users who want to explore the network.  
You can learn more about room directories [here](@/docs/chat_basics/public-rooms/_index.md#browsing-the-public-directory).

The Matrix.org Foundation offers a room directory as a public service via its matrix.org homeserver. It can be accessed by anyone, regardless of whether they use matrix.org or another homeserver instance.  

The matrix.org public room directory is highly visible and widely used by users from across the federation. To give new users a safe way to find interesting rooms, the Matrix.org Foundation curates the directory. The management of the directory is handled by the [Room Directory Working Group](@/foundation/working-groups/index.md).

Currently, the Foundation aims to showcase rooms and communities related to Matrix and other open-source projects. If you’d like to have your room(s) listed in the directory, you can submit an application via [this form](https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/BIhKmupHthnfRK9e7rdJnG0ilU2k0dJtazvIMlfNCds/).

If you want to explore a even wider range of public Matrix rooms, you can also browse the directories of other homeservers or community projects such as [matrixrooms.info](https://matrixrooms.info)
(these directories are independently operated and not affiliated with the Matrix.org Foundation).
