The Matrix.org Foundation is working hard to make sure Matrix is the best
protocol for free communication. Like any open protocol, Matrix needs a
direction to coordinate efforts. The Matrix.org Foundation is overseeing the
decisions related to the Matrix Specification, ensuring it serves the general
interest.

Once the direction is set, the Foundation also works on materialising the
vision: we're pragmatists who don't only work in theory. We want Matrix to
succeed in real life, so we make it happen in real life.

We also work on making sure the Matrix community stays vibrant and attractive.
It's important to keep the community active but also to attract newcomers in the
Matrix ecosystem. Onboarding and moderation are both key aspects of our mission.

Matrix is not only a good answer to current challenges: it needs to stay
relevant in the future. The Matrix.org Foundation funds substantial work to make
sure Matrix addresses and will keep addressing actual issues.
