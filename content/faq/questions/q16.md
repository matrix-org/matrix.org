### What is the difference between Matrix and PSYC?

TODO: currently PSYC has been excluded

PSYC is a open federated messaging protocol loosely inspired by IRC.  In
version 1 it was a standalone protocol, and in version 2 it is being
reutilised as a messaging layer on top of GNUnet.  We honestly don't
know that much about it, beyond trying to use psycd as an XMPP\<-\>IRC
bridge in 2010. Matrix differentiates primarily by providing simple HTTP
APIs rather than the more exotic compact line protocol in PSYC v1 or the
comprehensive GNUnet stack in v2, and Matrix focuses more on decentralised
conversation history rather than just decentralised chat servers.
On the other hand, Matrix doesn't provide the metadata protection
guarantees that GNUnet/PSYC aims for.
