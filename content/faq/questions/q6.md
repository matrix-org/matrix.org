### How is Matrix.org funded?

TODO-M: rewrite to include Status.im.

Matrix.org is currently (Sept 2017) funded by the community, through a
combination of community support (via
[Patreon](https://patreon.com/matrixdotorg),
[Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/matrixdotorg), Bitcoin and Ethereum),
corporate sponsorship, and grant funding.


Below is ok.

Current Elliptic-level supporters on
Patreon and corporate sponsors can be found on our [supporters
page](https://matrix.org/blog/supporters). 

If you would like to support the core Matrix team as a member of the community, you can do so via:

* [Patreon](https://patreon.com/matrixdotorg)
* [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/matrixdotorg)
* Bitcoin (address: 1LxowEgsquZ3UPZ68wHf8v2MDZw82dVmAE)
* Ethereum (address: 0xA5f9a4f9E024F6D727f7afdA9257e22329A97485)

If you would like to sponsor the
team as a corporation, or are interested in paying for prioritised or custom
development, please [get in touch](mailto:matthew@matrix.org).

For the first three years of Matrix's development (2014-2017), most of the core
contributors worked for [Amdocs](https://www.amdocs.com), who paid for them to
work fulltime on Matrix.  In July 2017, Amdocs considered the project to be
sufficiently successful that it could now self-support and so stopped funding.
The majority of the core team is now employed by [New Vector]{.definition}, an independent company
set up to hire the team and support Matrix's development.  Other contributors
are funded by their own employers or donate their own time to the project.
