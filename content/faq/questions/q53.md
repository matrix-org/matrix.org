Yes - the reference implementation is
[sydent](https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent) and you can run your own ID server cluster that tracks 3rd party to Matrix ID mappings.  This won't be very useful right now, though, and we don't recommend it.

If you want your server to participate in the global replicated Matrix ID
service then please get in touch with us. Meanwhile, we are looking at
ways of decentralising the 'official' Matrix identity service so that
identity servers are 100% decentralised and can openly federate with
each other. **N.B. that you can use Matrix without ever using the
identity service - it exists only to map 3rd party IDs (e.g. email
addresses) to matrix IDs to aid user discovery**.
