To make appropriate decisions, the T&S committee needs to know about the state of T&S in the wider ecosystem. It needs to have insights into current challenges, solutions and initiatives.
On the other hand the community can also benefit from having some of that information documented.
The T&S R&D WG is a tool to help with that. It includes a wider set of individuals and reports their research results to the T&S committee. The WG is also encouraged to enhance the [documentation](/docs) on the Matrix.org website to help communities and users on Matrix moderate their rooms.
The T&S committee might sometimes ask the WG for help in researching specific topics in more detail to guide their decisions.
