The Website and Content Working Group is responsible for the editorial and technical oversight of the main Matrix websites and social media channels.
This includes the main [matrix.org website](/), [conference website](https://conference.matrix.org), and the various social media channels.
The group is responsible for ensuring that the websites are up to date, accurate, and reflect the current state of the Matrix ecosystem.
It also includes [preparing and publishing](/twim-guide) the weekly This Week in Matrix news digest.
The group is not responsible for domain-specific content of other teams like the [spec](https://spec.matrix.org) website, matrix.org homeserver related configurations or the [legal](/legal) and [security](/security-disclosure-policy) sections of the website.

Note that this is not the complete list of responsibilities, but a high level overview.

### Purpose

Paramount to all these formalities we are introducing by creating a WG from a Foundation staffer with some volunteers, is to provide a framework that enables their work. This should particularly mean that everything we establish here should streamline things, avoid discussion by drawing clear lines, etc. and NOT drowning in bureaucracy. Some of these processes will necessarily introduce a bit of potential friction and we should be careful to design these parts as lightweight and streamlinable as possible.

### Membership

- the WG can let any community member in good standing join on its own judgement
- any GB member can join the WG
- the GB can recommend people to be considered for joining/removal

### Powers and responsibilities

- editorial rights to the matrix.org website repo, including blog & TWIM
  - except
    - security team has the security hall of fame subpage content
    - legal team has legal content
    - matrix.org homeserver team ("backend team") has things directly related to running the HS such as .well-known
    - (SCT has [spec.matrix.org](https://spec.matrix.org))
  - create process around blog posts e.g. to coordinate publishing on certain time
    - creates the responsibility of availability
    - on certain topics might require more setup, e.g. blog posts on security issues
    - this needs to be streamlined enough to avoid potential of e.g. too much nitpicking. for example pre-approving content, etc.
  - the WG may decide to not publish things or ask for changes, according to the content policy/communication strategy (see below). changes to the content require the original author's approval before publishing.
    - the WG can also delegate review approvals
  - establish clear criteria about projects listed under /ecosystem (e.g. maturity status, featured), to be signed off by the GB
  - create and maintain "core" content
    - initially: improve documentation/onboarding experience for new users and communities (e.g. the /docs page)
    - propose a list of things that are "core" content
  - establish a policy/clean-up process for unverified content
    - do docs authors have responsibility for their content?
- conference website, in agreement with the Events WG
  - here, events WG would be responsible for content, and Website WG for tech
  - process for joint responsibilities like this to be created by the joint WGs/teams
- TWIM helper/tooling repos
- administration of (deployed) tooling
  - e.g. TWIM bot
  - e.g. cloudflare
  - processes around this to be created by the WG. e.g. delegation of admin tasks (-> currently by SRE team on Fdn k8s)
- Matrix Live
  - for now, it seems to fit best in this WG
  - content creation can be delegated
  - review (content and technical e.g. editing) and publish it
- manage respective rooms: TWIM, TWIM offtopic, website, news room
  - Manage the [#community:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#community:matrix.org) space
    - making this known and establishing processes for it
  - shared with T&S
- socials
  - YouTube: descriptions, playlists, comments, ...
  - mastodon.matrix.org
    - decide what is the commitment for the @matrix account here
    - document some expectations to content posted/other interactions
    - blog posts and other things published by the WG are posted
    - set some baseline rules
  - etc -> see list in the Fdn handbook
    - see mastodon
    - document any accounts and who has access
- help establish the communication strategy/content policy and review any activity in the repo & other outlets to make sure we follow it
  - also see the existing proposals in the handbook
  - e.g. set a (technical) policy for pushes to main that all contributions must follow
  - e.g. m.org blog posts
  - e.g. label appearances of non-Foundation entities clearly on Matrix Live (e.g. Element Demos)
  - mark authors and explain their role
- technical oversight of shop.matrix.org
  - access to administrate it
  - ensuring that one can actually buy an article without the website exploding
  - ability to update documentation, i.e. making sure the modalities are as clear and easy to find as possible
  - this explicitly excludes decisions about the merchandise sold on the store and the financial aspects, but includes only the technical operation.

### Purpose

To make appropriate decisions, the T&S committee needs to know about the state of T&S in the wider ecosystem. It needs to have insights into current challenges, solutions and initiatives.
On the other hand the community can also benefit from having some of that information documented.
The T&S R&D WG is a tool to help with that. It includes a wider set of individuals and reports their research results to the T&S committee. In some cases the WG is also encouraged to enhance the documentation on matrix.org to help communities and users on Matrix moderate their rooms.
The T&S committee might sometimes ask the WG for help in researching specific topics in more detail to guide their decisions.

### Pledge of Confidentiality

The WG will sometimes have to deal or come in contact with confidential data, possibly
because of legal reasons, possibly because of active abuse concerns. While the
WG is encouraged to be open, there
will be times where the WG should keep certain information
confidential and only share it with specific individuals. As the WG we pledge
to keep information confidential when necessary while still being transparent
and open where possible.
The T&S committee may decide to remove members from the WG if it sees a member abusing their access to information or not acting in a trustworthy manner by sharing information the group agreed to keep confidential. This should be a last resort, needs a majority in the T&S committee and should be preceded by appropriate communication and warnings.

### Typical Tasks

- Gather information about current moderation challenges on Matrix and keep structured notes about them
- Maintain an overview of available moderation tools and their capabilities
- Create and maintain moderation guides on matrix.org in collaboration with the Website or Documentation WGs
- Reach out to moderators to gather feedback or offer advice
- Reports insights and opinions to the T&S committee and possibly other T&S working groups
- Potentially collaborate on proposals with the T&S committee or other WGs
- Turn some of their research into MSCs and collaboratively push them to completion as well as advise on other MSCs from a T&S perspective

### Membership

Interested members should be able to apply to the WG freely, but the WG and the T&S committee should do a short background check, if they are willing to give the applicant access to the information or if there are any active abuse concerns. This should be a low bar to clear, but is intended to keep malicious individuals out.

### Purpose

The Governance Working Group is the intended Working Group for discussing most of the tasks that are considered the main responsibility of the [Governance Committee](@/foundation/governing-board/committees.md#governance).

By making much of this procedure open, we intend to achieve transparency and give the community direct access to participate in the discussion and creation of proposals, while keeping the overhead small.

### Topics

The Governance Working Group works on various topics, such as:

* Maintenance of the Governing Board bylaws.
* Coordination with the Managing Director and the Guardians to fill any vacant seats on the Governing Board.
* Finding solutions to problems that withhold the Foundation from performing as intended, such as poor communication or bureaucracy.
* Defining official relationship statuses with the community, such as ecosystem memberships and sponsor tiers.

### Membership

Since the Working Group is expected to replace most of the daily business of the Committee discussing and developing proposals, all Governing Board Governance Committee members are always defined to be Working Group members.

Similarly, the Committee’s chair is considered the sponsor of the Working Group.

### Meeting schedule

The Working Group meets monthly by default. The frequency can be increased to biweekly if urgency and number of topics require it.
