I am an enthusiastic supporter of Matrix because I can imagine a world where everyone can communicate securely and privately, free of snooping and manipulation by powerful companies.

Email is awesome: it's time to level up to real-time, secure communication that is free from unwanted control and influence.

My priorities:

I want Matrix to last. When I look at the success of the Linux project, I see years of steady work paying off in the long term. I think Matrix should take the same approach: steadily working on creating an excellent open standard and excellent implementations of it. "Taking over the world" will inevitably come if the project is good enough, because the advantages of openness are so strong.

For Matrix to last, the foundation needs financial independence. I want to see the foundation raise more money, both from individuals and from corporate and government users.

The Matrix project has much to learn from its competitors. Key among these lessons: ease of use almost always wins.

While no protocol is ever complete, Matrix has achieved a substantial set of features. What is missing is polish. One of the challenges of an open, federated protocol is that no one organization owns the user experience. To develop Matrix into the easy, inviting, and practical option that it should be, the Matrix Project will need to collaborate with client developers, user groups, and homeserver operators. The Foundation should support projects with a meaningful impact on Matrix users while steering effort towards the quality of life features (like ease of use and performance) that currently leave Matrix uncompetitive.

Although relatively new to Matrix, I have devoted significant time to understanding the spec and SDK, primarily to develop Robrix: a multi-platform Matrix client built in Rust atop the emerging Robius app dev framework. Our goals with Robrix are to bring a consistent, performant, and lightweight Matrix experience to every mainstream platform, further demonstrating the power of both Matrix and Rust together.

We also directly sponsor and contribute to other Matrix-coupled projects, such as (1) a new Matrix server backend in Rust, and (2) fully-local LLM engines embeddable into applications like Robrix, allowing users to benefit from convenient AI features like chat summaries without jeopardizing E2EE and data sovereignty.

I will bring a systems programmer’s perspective to the Board and focus on practical improvements and extensions to both the spec and Rust SDK. My colleagues, open-source collaborators, and I will work hard to drive the adoption of Matrix forward and to further the cause of federated technologies."""

The TI-Messenger serves as a secure and efficient channel for sharing medical data, test results, and treatment plans among healthcare providers, institutions, and patients. It ensures that sensitive information remains protected through robust end-to-end encryption and a decentralized architecture, built upon the Matrix Protocol. This encryption guarantees privacy, preventing unauthorized access to patient data and instilling trust among users.

Moreover, the TI-Messenger prioritizes compliance with data protection regulations, ensuring that patient data is handled with the utmost care and in accordance with legal requirements. By maintaining strict privacy standards, gematik's TI-Messenger fosters a safe and secure environment for collaboration, ultimately enhancing patient care and outcomes.

In summary, gematik's TI-Messenger represents a significant leap forward in Germany's digital healthcare landscape."""

platform_statement = """While the Matrix ecosystem in general embrace FOSS, we truly believe that FOSS is very much "compatible" with for-profit businesses. As a commercial for-profit company building on Matrix, we have a vested interest in the success and sustainability of Matrix. We believe that a key factor will be to ensure that commercial businesses can reap concrete and quantifiable benefits by contributing to Matrix. The challenge of course is to have the companies contribute in a way that aligns with Matrix’ vision, and to ensure contributions don’t compromise the integrity of the foundation, and the community.

Many things need to come together to achieve this, and we certainly don't have all the answers and fixes. The current direction of the community and the foundation is essential. Clarifying the roles of the most influential  stakeholders in the community is IMO an absolute requirement for a "climate" conducive to businesses and commercial stakeholders. Equally important for companies is to strike a good balance between resources spent, benefits, and competitive advantages.

We hope to bring the viewpoint of a for-profit company into the GB and help make the Matrix attractive for commercial businesses for the mutual benefit of the companies, and the community."""

I hope to bring my experience leading the project so far to help navigate these choices most effectively, and work with the wider governing board to multiply Matrix's success in future.
