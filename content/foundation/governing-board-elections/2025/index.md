## What is the Governing Board

This page is focused on the 2025 election cycle. We encourage you to [learn more about the Governing Board itself here.](/foundation/governing-board/) 

## Schedule

* Campaigning from Saturday, May 17 to Friday, May 30
* Voting from Saturday, May 31 to Friday, June 13

### Announcement (April 28)

[We kickstarted the election process](/blog/2025/04/election-announcement/) in a blog post announcing the schedule, eligibility, and conditions of the vote.

This year, we are running elections for the following [constituency groups](/foundation/governing-board/):

* Gold Members
* Silver Members
* Individual Members
* Associate Members

### Nominations (May 3)

Nominations for the 2025 elections are complete, and you can [find the nominees below](#nominees).

You must be a member of one of the constituency groups in order to nominate yourself or someone else to be a candidate in the election. If you intend to nominate someone else, you need to get their consent ahead of time.

By far our largest constituency group are Individual Members, who number in the 100’s. If you have donated at least $60 USD to the Foundation since April 20, 2024 on [Donorbox](https://donorbox.org/keep-matrix-exciting), then you are eligible to nominate and vote. You must donate before the election period begins, as we cannot change voter rolls after that.

Eligible members can proceed to nominations using [the Cryptpad nomination form](https://cryptpad.fr/form/#/2/form/view/7a4+m2eSNxmdPGf5kWh4GQ6i2wzUK315LdNJyBoAVsc/) or email the filled out [pdf form](/media/2025-nomination-form.pdf).

All nominations are subject to review in accordance with our bylaws. We will email you to confirm receipt within 2 business days, and we will publish all of the nominees, and other details, here on this page on May 17th.

If you want to be a candidate in the election, there are a few things you should know:

* All candidates will be listed on our website, grouped by the constituency group.
* We do not require people to use their “legal name.”
* Candidates who are nominated by an organizational member will have their affiliation listed.
* We expect candidates to provide a short bio and a short statement, collectively covering qualifications and priorities. Candidates may also provide a link to an extended statement or platform on their personal blog or website.
* You are encouraged to make yourself available for conversation with members of your constituency group.
* The period for campaigning runs from May 17th to May 30th. Please note our [community Code of Conduct](/legal/code-of-conduct/) while campaigning.

For reference, you can find last year's nominations on our [2024 election center](/foundation/governing-board-elections/2024/) page.

### Campaigning (May 17)

The campaign period is an opportunity for candidates to share more about themselves and their priorities. We encourage candidates to engage with the rest of the ecosystem, and in particular those who are part of the same constituency group.

Thanks to a proactive member of the community, we have [a dedicated Matrix space](https://matrix.to/#/#governing-board-nominee-campaigning-bonfire:matrix.org) with rooms for candidates and constituents to communicate with one another:

* [All nominees](https://matrix.to/#/#gbncb-all:matrix.org)
* [Gold Member nominees](https://matrix.to/#/#gbnc-gold:matrix.org)
* [Silver Member nominees](https://matrix.to/#/#gbnc-silver:matrix.org)
* [Associate Member nominees](https://matrix.to/#/#gbnc-associate:matrix.org)
* [Individual Member nominees](https://matrix.to/#/#gbnc-individual:matrix.org)

### Voting (May 31)

The voting period will run from **May 31st to June 13th**. All eligible voters will receive an email from [OpaVote](https://www.opavote.com/) – the election system we have chosen for this year’s elections.

All members of each constituency group are entitled to vote on the candidates within that constituency group. If you believe you are eligible to participate but have not heard from us, first check the inbox and spam folders of the email address you have on file with us through Donorbox. [Please email us](mailto:elections@foundation.matrix.org) if you have any questions.

We will hold an election for all of the four constituencies even if a given constituency has fewer candidates than there are seats allocated for them on the Governing Board. This is, effectively, as a vote of confidence.

### Results (June 16)

Results will be announced on June 16th. All elected representatives will be added to a private mailing list and Matrix room so that they can introduce themselves and communicate in between meetings. The Foundation's Managing Director and the Governing Board's Chair and/or Vice Chair will be reaching out to every elected representative to get new members onboarded as quickly as possible.

The Governing Board will meet as a full board at least twice a year, for at least 90 minutes each time. We'll aim to have a meeting shortly after the election, and you can expect one meeting before the end of the year and another before the next election.

Members of the Governing Board are likely to receive a packet of materials before each meeting which they will be expected to have reviewed. Most meetings will be held online, though we may convene meetings in-person, such as at The Matrix Conference. We will make every effort to make in-person meetings accessible to remote participants, and no official business will ever happen without appropriate notice, quorum, and minutes.

While the Governing Board is an advisory board, members are encouraged to play a role in helping to carry out the activities that support the staff in delivering on the Foundation’s collective remit, such as coalescing priorities to share with the Spec Core Team and connecting with contributors and funders to implement proposals.

The Governing Board has a number of Committees and Working Groups which meet and work in between Governing Board meetings. These are where the bulk of the activity will take place since the board, which may have up to 24 members, is quite large.

## Nominees

We are honored to present the nominees for the Governing Board elections, and are grateful to everyone who has raised their hands. We are positively overwhelmed by the enthusiasm and vision expressed by our nominees.
