The Governing Board is an advisory board that is made up of elected representatives from all across the Matrix ecosystem. The role of the Governing Board is to offer guidance and support to the Guardians, Foundation staff, and Spec Core Team. It is organized under [these terms of reference](/media/2025-04-governing-board-terms-of-reference.pdf) (v1.3, last updated April 2025).

There are nine different constituency groups that are allocated seats on the Governing Board, across three categories:

* **Community representatives**
  * 4 seats for Individual Members — these are people who currently provide individual financial support to the Foundation.
  * 3 seats for Ecosystem Members — these are FOSS projects and communities around Matrix.
  * 2 seats for Associate Members — these are FOSS foundations, academic institutions, and other communities that are aligned with key parts of our mission.
* **Funder representatives**
  * 4 seats for Platinum Members — these organisations sponsor at the highest level.
  * 3 seats for Gold Members — these organisations sponsor at a high level.
  * 2 seats for Silver Members — these organisations sponsor at a level commensurate with the size of their organisation.
* **Foundation representatives**
  * 3 seats for [Guardians](/foundation/about#the-guardians) — these are the members of the Foundation's board of directors.
  * 2 seats for [the Spec Core Team](/foundation/about#the-spec-core-team) — these are the members of the Spec Core Team that looks after the spec.
  * [Managing Director](/foundation/about#managing-director) — this is the Foundation's head of staff.

To become a member, support the Foundation, be eligible to vote (in the Individual Members category), and even to stand as a candidate, please see our [Membership Page](/membership).

## Bylaws, Processes, and Norms

These documents cover the Matrix Governing Board, its purpose, operations, and
processes. The content is divided into the following sections:

- [**Terms of Reference (TOR)**](/media/2025-04-governing-board-terms-of-reference.pdf):
  The immutable basis for the Governing Board. The TOR outline the Board's
  purpose, mandate, and authority.
- [**Bylaws and Expectations**](./bylaws/02-bylaws): The comprehensive rules,
  structures, and expectations for the Board, committees, and working groups,
  layered on top of the TOR.
- [**Social Contract**](./bylaws/03-social-contract): The agreed social norms,
  standards of conduct, and principles for interaction and transparency.
- [**Processes**](./bylaws/04-processes): Practical procedures for
  decision-making, proposals, conflict resolution, transparency, and other
  operational matters.

The Governance Committee is responsible for adapting these documents as needed,
with the exception of the TOR, which requires formal amendment from the
Guardians. These documents are currently v1.1.0 and were last modified on
