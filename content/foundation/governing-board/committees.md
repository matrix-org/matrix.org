The Committees of the Governing Board are subgroups focusing on specific areas of interest to The Matrix Foundation.
They are the primary working units of the Board and consist exclusively of Board members.
Committees host [Working Groups](@/foundation/working-groups/index.md) to enable broader community participation in the Foundation.
You can learn more about how Committees work in the [Bylaws of the Governing Board](@/foundation/governing-board/bylaws/02-bylaws.md#4-committees).

There are currently 4 Committees:

* [Community](#community)
* [Governance](#governance)
* [Trust & Safety](#trust-safety)
* [Finance & Fundraising](#finance-fundraising)

## Community

### Charter

> #### Purpose
> 
> The community represents the majority of the individuals interested in Matrix. As such the community can be a major driving force behind the adoption and development of Matrix. On the other hand the community also has strong opinions and expectations.
> 
> The Community Committee tries to bridge that gap to foster a healthy relationship with the community. It helps organize outreach and steers communication from the Foundation while encouraging participation and listening to concerns from the community.
> 
> #### Powers and Duties
> 
> The community committee:
> 
> - is responsible for and defines guidelines for outbound communication
> - plans or supports community outreach
> - provides and improves options for community participation
> - enables the community to collaborate with each other
> - categorizes community concerns and helps align interests in the wider ecosystem
> - maintains documentation and information channels for the community
> 
> Some of these duties might be delegated to working groups, where the Community
> Committee acts as the supervisor.

### Members

## Governance

### Charter

> #### Purpose
> 
> The Governance Committee exists to determine how The Matrix Foundation should be structured. It determines why the Foundation is structured the way it is, or look for alternatives when the Foundation has visible flaws.
> 
> The Governance Committee determines the values of the Foundation. This regards autonomy towards individual sponsors, the future of the Foundation, and to handle governance issues such as disagreements between the Governing Board and the Guardians.
> 
> #### Powers and Duties
> 
> The Governance Committee has:
> 
> - The ability to coordinate with the Managing Director and the Guardians to fill any vacant seats on the Governing Board.
> - The responsibility to maintain the board's processes (such as chair/vice-chair votes & elections)
> - The responsibility to offer advice on the Foundation's scope and focus, determining what values the Foundation should prioritize.
> - The designation to evaluate the wider Foundation's processes and its organisational branches whenever the Governing Board as a whole is expected to do so.
