title = "Governing Board: Social Contract"
+++

As members of the **Matrix Governing Board**, we are committed to fostering a
productive, respectful, and transparent environment in which we can collaborate
effectively. These social norms will guide our internal interactions and also
set expectations for how we communicate externally.

---

## **Board-Internal Norms**

1. **Create Space for Productive Exploration:**

   * Strive to embody the principle of **charitable interpretation**. Approach
     each other’s ideas and concerns with good faith, seeking to understand
     rather than immediately critique.  
   * Allow space for the exploration of ideas, including those that may be
     underdeveloped or not yet fully thought out. **Patience and openness** to
     diverse perspectives will strengthen our decision-making process.  

2. **Default to Board Public:**

   * Discussions among subsets of the Board should ultimately be brought back
     to the **whole Governing Board**. This ensures that we maintain a shared
     context, promote transparency, and avoid creating factions within the group.  
   * This will largely be done via the reporting mechanisms between the Working
     Groups, the Committees, and the Board Chair.  
   * It is accepted that some Working Groups will need to keep their work
     private, but their reports to the Committee Chair should still convey the
     essence of their work.  
   * Decisions and important updates should be accessible to the entire Board
     so we stay aligned and unified in our actions.  

3. **Chatham House Rule:**

   * When participating in sensitive discussions, we will adhere to the
     **Chatham House Rule**. We are free to use the information shared, but we
     must **not reveal the identity or affiliation** of the speakers or
     participants unless explicitly stated otherwise.  
   * This protects individuals' privacy and fosters a safer space for open,
     candid conversations.  

4. **Use the [Discourse Forum](https://matrix.discourse.group) as the Canonical Space:**

   * The [**Discourse Forum**](https://matrix.discourse.group) is the official,
     primary place for our Board’s discussions and decision-making. While other
     communication channels (e.g., chat, Google Drive, etc) may be used for informal
     discussions & collaboration, **Board members should be active on the forum** to
     ensure that decisions are made with transparency and all members are fully informed.
   * The **Discourse Forum** will relay new topics & posts to the **Governing
     Board Matrix room** to try and keep members informed.  
   * This forum should serve as the **central hub** for documentation,
     decisions, and ongoing conversations.  

5. **No “Ex Cathedra” Communication:**

   * **No single Board member** has the authority to speak for or make
     statements on behalf of the entire Board without consensus. All
     communication and decisions must represent the collective will of the Board.  
   * If statements need to be made publicly or externally, these should reflect
     the Board’s unified position.  

6. **Respect for Time:**

   * Be mindful of each other’s time. **Don’t rush decisions or request urgent
     reviews** with less than 7 days’ notice, unless in an **emergency
     situation** that demands immediate action.  
   * Allow sufficient time for thoughtful review and feedback, enabling each
     Board member to participate fully in discussions and decision-making.  
   * Meetings will be scheduled with enough time to find the best date for
     everyone \- typically 2 weeks notice for Committee meetings and 4 weeks
     notice for Board meetings.  

7. **Foster Inclusivity and Equal Participation:**

   * Each Board member is encouraged to contribute their ideas, feedback, and
     concerns. **Everyone’s voice matters**, and we should actively ensure that
     quieter voices are heard and valued.  
   * Respect and support one another’s contributions, fostering an atmosphere
     where all members feel comfortable participating.  
   * Thought should be given to the voices and expertise that are not “in the
     room”. While those who turn up consistently will be the ones who get to
     form the decisions, they should seek to incorporate views from further afield.  

8. **Engage with Constructive Disagreement:**

   * Disagreement is natural and can be productive, but we must always approach
     it **constructively**. Focus on resolving issues, exploring alternative
     solutions, and learning from differing viewpoints.  
   * Respectful debate is welcomed, but personal attacks, interruptions, or
     hostility will not be tolerated.  

9. **Maintain Transparency and Integrity:**

   * Our actions and decisions should be transparent to the rest of the Board
     and, where applicable, to the broader community. **Full disclosure** is
     essential in building trust and ensuring collective accountability.  
   * When making decisions or discussing issues, be open about your thought
     process, rationale, and any potential biases you may have.  

10. **Honor Commitments and Deadlines:**

    * Uphold commitments to deadlines, meetings, and agreed-upon actions. If
      you cannot meet a deadline, **communicate early and proactively** to find
      a solution.  
    * When reviewing materials or documents, be thorough and provide feedback
      on time to respect everyone’s efforts and the Board’s progress.

## **Board-External Norms**

1. **Official Meeting Summaries:**

   * After official meetings, we will share **neutral summaries** of the topics
     discussed and public decisions made.  
   * Summaries may be posted externally, but they must:  
     * Be **neutral** in tone, focusing on the issues discussed rather than
       opinions expressed.  
     * Follow **Chatham House rules**, ensuring that no specific opinions or
       affiliations of Board members are revealed.  
   * In some cases, especially for sensitive discussions (e.g., **Trust and
     Safety Committee**), summaries may not be appropriate.  
   * **Summaries must be posted on the Discourse Forum** for a **Feedback
     Vote**, which will be open for at least 24 hours before finalization.  

2. **Official Statements of the Board:**

   * It must be clear when a public statement is an **official position of the
     Board** and not an individual member’s opinion.  
   * Formal **votes must be taken** to approve statements, ensuring that the
     statement represents the collective will of the Board. Any statement made
     without a vote will be considered a violation of **ex cathedra** communication.  

3. **Personal Opinions on Topics Currently Being Considered by the Board:**

   * Board members are welcome to post **personal opinions** on topics that are
     under consideration, but these opinions must be clearly presented as the
     views of the **individual** member, not the Board as a whole.  

4. **Personal Opinions on Decisions Made by the Board:**

   * After the Board has made a decision, members should generally **refrain
     from publishing dissenting or concurring opinions** publicly. Doing so
     will be seen as an **escalation** and outside the communication norms.  
   * In cases of dissent, the **official statement** of the Board should
     include a rationale, explaining why alternative views were not adopted.
     This approach should minimize the need for members to publish individual
     opinions.  

5. **Personal Opinions on Topics Not Currently Being Considered by the Board:**

   * Board members are free to **publish personal opinions** on topics **not
     currently being considered by the Board**, including those related to
     **Matrix** or other non-Board topics. This allows individual members to express
     themselves on matters outside the Board's jurisdiction.
