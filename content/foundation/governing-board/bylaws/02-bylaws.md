title = "Governing Board: Bylaws & Expectations"
+++

This document contains the detailed rules and expectations for the operation of
the Matrix Governing Board, including membership, meetings, elections, roles,
responsibilities, and behavioral standards. All content must be consistent with
the Terms of Reference (TOR).

## 1. Board Structure & Mandate

The Governing Board is made up of members elected by the community. As a
collective, board members have the following rights and responsibilities:

* choosing their own leadership (such as the Chair and Vice Chair of the
  Board),  
* the creation and dissolution of committees,  
* officially approving or disapproving of committee activities and proposals,  
* updating this governance structure and eventually adopting it as formal
  bylaws,  
* handling community reports and complaints about governance violations  
* making and responding to requests from the community, the Matrix.org
  Foundation, and other stakeholders,  
* and making official communications on behalf of the Governing Board.

## 2. Voting

The rules and procedures for voting by the Governing Board are governed by the
Terms of Reference (TOR) of the Matrix.org Foundation. Please refer to the TOR
for the current, authoritative rules on voting, quorum, and decision-making
processes for the Board.

**Current Practice:** For day-to-day decisions, the Board typically uses a
simple majority (for example, 11 out of 20 for the full Board), or whatever
majority is required in committees, which may have variable membership sizes.
This practice is for clarity and convenience, but the TOR remains the
authoritative source.

*This section will be revisited and expanded in future drafts, ensuring full
alignment with the TOR.*

## 3. Board Member Expectations

The Governing Board is not a vanity board, but a working board, and members
stand for election being aware that they will have work to do. Board members
are expected to:
- contribute to the Committee's work and to the broader Governing Board.
- be responsive to the Committee's members and to the broader Governing Board.
- adhere to the social contract.
- participate in Discourse discussions & votes in a timely manner.
- participate in at least one Committee and at least one Working Group.

## 4. Committees

### How Committees Work

Given the size of the Governing Board, most of the actual working of the board
will take place through committees. Committees usually chair Working Groups,
which are open to broader community participation.

Committees are the primary working units of the Board. Board members are
expected to participate in Committees, which consist of three or more members
and must have a Chair and a Vice Chair. Upon creation, each Committee selects a
provisional Chair, creates a charter, and establishes a meeting or discussion
cadence/process. New Committees are expected to be infrequent, and proposed
by at least 3 Board members. Proposals for new Committees must include an
initial draft charter and be presented in the Board Discussions forum; a simple
majority vote of the Board is sufficient to create a Committee.

Committees are primarily composed of Governing Board members (with rare
exceptions). Their main role is to coordinate and provide strategic oversight
for their respective Working Groups, rather than carry out work directly.
Committees should focus on enabling, supporting, and reporting on the
activities of their Working Groups, which are open to broader community
participation. Direct execution of tasks by committees should be the exception,
not the norm.

Committees are required to take notes in meetings and strive to make their work
public where possible, for transparency and accountability. Members of the
Trust & Safety committee (and potentially other committees handling sensitive
information) must sign an NDA with the Matrix.org Foundation to meet compliance
obligations.

Each Committee should maintain a dedicated Matrix room and Discourse category
for communication, documentation, and voting.

### Proposing New Committees

For the detailed process of proposing and creating new committees, please refer
to the 'Committee Creation Process' section in 
[**Processes**](../04-processes/#committee-creation-process).

### Committee Chair and Vice Chair Expectations

Committee chairs are facilitators, their job is to enable the Committee to keep
moving, work with Sponsors on Working Groups, and recommend reports to the Board
and the Foundation. Chairs are expected to:
- be responsive to the Committee's members and to the broader Governing Board.
- lead their committee in a fair, transparent, and accountable manner.
- report up to the Board Chair on a regular basis to keep the Board informed of
  the committee's activities and decisions, and the progress of the Working
  Groups.
- assist in drafting/amending the Committee's charter and Chair selection.

## 5. Working Groups

### How Working Groups Work

Working Groups are the life of the Board – most of the work gets done here.
They convene, organize, and formally recognize ongoing work that supports the
Matrix ecosystem. They are sponsored and overseen by a Governing Board
Committee. Anyone in good standing may participate in a Working Group.
Membership is expected to ebb and flow; what matters is clarity of purpose (the
Charter), progress (meeting minutes), and outstanding tasks.

Working Groups must have at least three members initially. Upon
creation, each Working Group selects a provisional Chair, creates a
charter, and sets up a meeting or discussion cadence/process.
Working Groups belong to one Committee, but may work closely with
several Committees.

Working Groups must have a dedicated public Matrix room (which will
be listed on
[the Working Groups webpage](https://matrix.org/foundation/working-groups/)
and the [Working Groups Matrix space](https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-wgs:matrix.org))
and have access to a Discourse category for communication with the Board,
documentation, and voting. In order to ensure transparency and
accountability, Working Groups should take notes in meetings and
generally do their best to make their work public where possible.

### Proposing New Working Groups

For the detailed process of proposing and creating new Working Groups, please
refer to the 'Working Group Creation Process' section in
[**Processes**](../04-processes/#working-group-creation-process).

### Working Group Sponsors Expectations

Sponsors provide a liaison role between the Working Group and the Board,
channeling output to the Board. Sponsors are thus expected to:
- be responsive to the Working Group's members and to the broader Governing
  Board.
- report up to the Committee on a regular basis.
- assist in drafting/amending the Working Group's charter and Chair selection.
- assist the Working Group with any process work related to the Board.
- The Board Sponsor is responsible for submitting reports to the relevant
  Committee Chair, at least in advance of the committee’s regular report.

### Working Group Member Expectations

Working Group membership is expected to ebb and flow, and is not a formal
thing. The community will naturally have various people interested in different
topics. What matters is that the Working Group is clear on its purpose (the
Charter), its progress (the meeting minutes), and its outstanding tasks. This
will allow prospective members to contribute.

Some Working Groups will need a more formal membership process, because of the
access or responsibilities they deal with. It is acceptable for the Working
Group to define this for themselves, providing:

1. They document the process (ideally publicly on their Working
   Group website page on matrix.org, but at least for the Board).
2. The process does not loosen the existing restrictions on
   participating with the Foundation in general (i.e. members should
   be in good standing and aim to improve Matrix as a whole).

### Working Group Chairs and Vice Chairs Expectations

The role of (Vice) Chair in a Working Group is not expected to be onerous. The
Board Sponsor will help with necessary process-related work such as reporting
to the Committee Chair, and (if needed) drafting minutes. Most work in a
Working Group is consensus driven, and in any case voting is difficult because
of the fluid nature of the membership.

Where a consensus cannot be reached, the Chair can ask the Board Sponsor to
help resolve the issue - likely by asking the Committee to decide on the
direction needed.

## 6. Chair & Vice Chair of the Governing Board

The Chair of the Governing Board is a facilitator, and the Vice Chair is
someone who can support the Chair as well as stand in for them when needed.
Facilitation includes running meetings, helping to assemble agendas and gather
meeting materials, and coordinating with committee chairs.

Critically, the Chair has a role in setting the tone of discussions and
ensuring that the Board moves forward and serves as an effective Governing
Board. This can include time keeping, reminding members of policies, helping
maintain perspective and avoid unproductive ruts and bikeshedding, and
sometimes privately reaching out to individuals to help them be more effective
participants. Ideally, the Chair also has an eye on leadership development and
succession planning, to ensure operational continuity.

One needn’t have been a Chair previously in order to be qualified for the role,
but one should strive for these qualities:
* Leadership skills  
* Communication skills  
* Strategic thinking  
* Collaborative  
* Decisive  
* High integrity  
* Adaptable

Vice Chairs (of the Board and of Committees) are able to act in the stead of
the Chair whenever the Chair is not available (ideally with notice and
permission from the Chair). In the event that a Chair is not re-elected (or
steps down), the Vice Chair is likely the best candidate to be named as the new
Chair, as they will have been working closely with the Chair and will have a
good understanding of the Board's processes and procedures, and the work the
Chair was overseeing. It is recommended that Chairs and Vice Chairs communicate
closely and regularly.

## 7. Reporting Structure

### Board Reporting

- The Board is responsible for ensuring overall transparency and accountability
  to the Matrix community and stakeholders.
- The Board will publish public reports at least twice per year, typically as
  part of a board press release following a Governing Board meeting.
- These reports should summarize major decisions, strategic directions, and key
  outcomes from committees and working groups.
- The Board Chair is responsible for collating committee and working group
  reports and structuring the final public report.

### Committee Reporting

- Committees must provide regular updates and discussion in the designated
  forum (board-public) to keep the Board and community informed of their
  activities.
- Each committee is expected to submit a report at least once per quarter, to
  be summarised and included in the Board’s biannual public report.
- Committee Chairs are responsible for drafting and submitting these reports,
  incorporating input from their working groups.
- Committees should strive for additional reporting and transparency as
  appropriate for their area of responsibility.

These are minimum requirements - committees are encouraged to find their own
cadence and report out more frequently if possible.

### Working Group Reporting

- Working Groups are expected to maintain regular communication with their
  sponsoring committee, providing updates on progress, challenges, and
  outcomes.
- Each Working Group is expected to submit a report at least once per month, to
  be summarised and included in the Board’s biannual public report.
- The Board sponsor for each Working Group is responsible for submitting
  reports to the relevant Committee Chair, at least in advance of the
  committee’s regular report.
- Working Groups should take and share meeting notes, and are encouraged to
  provide more frequent updates to the committee and, where appropriate, the
  wider community.
- All reporting should respect privacy and confidentiality requirements,
  especially for sensitive topics (e.g., Trust & Safety).

These are minimum requirements - working groups are encouraged to find their
own cadence and report out more frequently if possible.

## 8. Officer Elections

We will hold elections once a year as per the Terms of Reference (TOR) of the
Matrix.org Foundation. At present, there are no defined term limits within the
Board, provided a member gets re-elected.
