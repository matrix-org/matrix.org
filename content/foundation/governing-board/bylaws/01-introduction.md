# Matrix Governing Board: Introduction & Reference to TOR

These documents cover the Matrix Governing Board, its purpose, operations, and
processes. The content is divided into the following sections:

- [**Terms of Reference (TOR)**](https://matrix.org/media/2024-04-governing-board-terms-of-reference.pdf):
  The immutable basis for the Governing Board. The TOR outlines the Board's
  purpose, mandate, and authority.
- [**Bylaws and Expectations**](../bylaws/02-bylaws): The comprehensive rules,
  structures, and expectations for the Board, committees, and working groups,
  layered on top of the TOR.
- [**Social Contract**](../bylaws/03-social-contract): The agreed social norms,
  standards of conduct, and principles for interaction and transparency.
- [**Processes**](../bylaws/04-processes): Practical procedures for
  decision-making, proposals, conflict resolution, transparency, and other
  operational matters.

The Governance Committee is responsible for adapting these documents as needed,
with the exception of the TOR, which requires formal amendment from the
Guardians. These documents are currently v1.0 and were last modified on
2025-05-09
