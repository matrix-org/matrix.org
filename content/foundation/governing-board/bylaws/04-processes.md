+++

This section describes the practical procedures for decision-making, proposals,
conflict resolution, transparency, and other operational matters.

## Committee Creation Process

Board members are encouraged to propose new committees, provided there is a
clear scope and at least three interested members. Any Board member can propose
a new committee in the Board Discussions forum. The proposal must include an
initial draft charter, which should be defined before the committee is created.
A simple majority vote of the Board is sufficient to create the committee.

## Working Group Creation Process

We intend for the community to be able to propose new Working Groups, as the
community has many talented and knowledgable members - but we do not wish for
additional loads to be placed upon the Board without it’s approval, and we want
to ensure that new Working Groups have some support rather than being a
one-person idea.

To that end, new Working Groups can be proposed by any member of the Matrix
Community. However, we expect a minimum of three members, and we require one of
those three to be a Board member, a Sponsor to act as liaison with the Board
and facilitate the work being done.

Therefore, those interested in creating a Working Group are encouraged to
contact the Board to find a Sponsor - your constituency representatives would
be a good place to look for such support to start with (TBD add a link to
explain constituencies here).

If the Sponsor Board Member agrees with the idea, they will discuss initial
membership of the new Working Group and a rough draft of its potential charter
with the initiator(s). Finally the Sponsor brings the proposal up with the rest
of the Board for discussion.

Ultimately, if the Board approve the initial members and scope, the Working
Group will be created and place under an appropriate Committee, and will report
it’s activities & recommendations to that Committee. It’s first task would be
to refine the initial rough charter, and have it ratified bythe Committee.

## Chair Re-election Process

If a Chair of a Committee or the Board is not re-elected during the election
cycle (or wishes to step down), the following process shall be followed in
order to ensure continuity of the Board's operations and to ensure that the
outgoing Chair is able to complete all outstanding tasks and hand over to the
incoming Chair. This process applies to both the Board Chair and Committee
Chairs.

1. **Notification Period**: The Board shall be notified of the election
   outcome, and the outgoing Chair shall be informed of the election result,
   within a week of the election result being confirmed.
2. **Transition Period**: The outgoing Chair shall have four weeks to complete
   all outstanding tasks and hand over to the incoming Chair. During this period,
   the outgoing Chair shall:
    * Work with the committee to select a new Chair.
    * Ensure all ongoing work is completed, or delegated to other Board members
      where possible.
    * Document all relevant information and tasks to be completed.
    * Inform the Managing Director and the Guardians of any outstanding
      actions.
3. **Handover Meeting**: The outgoing Chair shall convene a meeting with the
   incoming Chair and the Board Chair (or Managing Director if the Board Chair is
   deselected) to formally hand over the role. This meeting shall be held within
   the Transition Period.
4. **Board Notification**: The outgoing Chair shall notify the Board of the
   handover meeting, and the Board shall be invited to attend.

## Sponsor Re-election Process

If a Sponsor of a Working Group is not re-elected during the election cycle (or
wishes to step down), the following process shall be followed in order to
ensure continuity of the Working Group's operations and to ensure that the
outgoing Sponsor is able to complete all outstanding tasks and hand over to the
incoming Sponsor.

1. **Notification Period**: The Working Group shall be notified of the election
   outcome, and the outgoing Sponsor shall be informed of the election result,
   within a week of the election result being confirmed.
2. **Transition Period**: The outgoing Sponsor shall have four weeks to
   complete all outstanding tasks and hand over to the incoming Sponsor. During
   this period, the outgoing Sponsor shall:
    * Work with the Working Group to select a new Sponsor.
    * Ensure all ongoing work is completed, or delegated to other Working Group
      members where possible.
    * Document all relevant information and tasks to be completed.
    * Inform the Managing Director and the Guardians of any outstanding
      actions.
3. **Handover Meeting**: The outgoing Sponsor shall convene a meeting with the
   incoming Sponsor and the Committee Chair to formally hand over the role. This
   meeting shall be held within the Transition Period.
4. **Working Group Notification**: The outgoing Sponsor shall notify the
   Working Group of the handover meeting, and the Working Group shall be invited
   to attend.

## Board Member Removal Process

If a Board Member is not meeting the expectations of the role, the following
process shall be followed to remove them from the Board:

### Standard Removal Process

If a Board Member is not meeting the expectations of the role, but is not
actively harmful, the following process shall be followed to remove them from
the Board:

1. **First Warning**: The Board shall send a written warning to the
   underperforming Board Member, outlining the specific expectations that are
   not being met, and the steps that need to be taken in order to meet them. The
   Board shall also schedule a call or discussion with the Board Member to discuss
   the reasons for the underperformance, and to work together to develop a plan to
   address the issues.
2. **Second Warning**: If the Board Member has not met the expectations
   outlined in the first warning, the Board shall send a second written
   warning. This warning shall outline the specific actions that need to be taken,
   and the timeframe in which they need to be completed. The Board shall also
   schedule a second call or discussion with the Board Member to discuss the
   progress of the plan, and to work together to resolve any remaining issues.
3. **Removal**: If the Board Member has not met the expectations outlined in
   the second warning, the Board shall hold a vote to remove the Board Member
   from the Board. A two-thirds majority is required to remove a Board Member.
4. **Handover**: The Board shall attempt to hold a call or discussion with the
   Board Member to discuss the handover of their responsibilities and to ensure
   a smooth transition. If the Board Member is not responsive, the Board shall
   proceed with the handover without their input. The Board shall be provided with
   a written handover report.

### Emergency Removal Process

In exceptional circumstances, the Board Chair and the Vice Chair (acting
jointly) or the Guardians may remove a Board Member without following the
Standard Removal Process. This power can only be exercised when there is strong
evidence that the Board Member is actively harmful, breaking the Social
Contract, and engaging in behaviour that is detrimental to the project. A
minimum of two people is required to exercise this power, and the removal must
be justified with a written explanation to the Board of the reasons for the
action.

1. **Notification**: The Board shall send a written notification to the Board
   Member, outlining the specific reasons for the removal. If appropriate, the
   Board shall also schedule a call or discussion with the Board Member to discuss
   the reasons for the removal, and to work together to develop a plan to address
   the issues.  As part of this notification, the Board shall also:
   * immediately suspend the Board Member's access to Matrix Foundation
     systems, repositories and infrastructure;
   * suspend the Board Member's voting rights until the situation is resolved;
   * inform the Board of the situation.
2. **Removal**: The Board shall hold a vote to remove the Board Member from the
   Board. A two-thirds majority is required to remove a Board Member.
3. **Handover**: The Board shall attempt to hold a call or discussion with the
   Board Member to discuss the handover of their responsibilities and to ensure a
   smooth transition. If the Board Member is not responsive, the Board shall
   proceed with the handover without their input. The Board shall be provided with
   a written handover report.
4. **Abuse of Power Safeguard**: In the event that the Board Chair and the Vice
   Chair (acting jointly) or the Guardians are deemed to have abused the Emergency
   Removal Process, the Board may vote to reinstate the removed Board Member. To
   do so, a two-thirds majority of the Board (not including the Board Chair or the
   Vice Chair, if they are involved in the decision) must agree that the removal
   was an overreach of power.
