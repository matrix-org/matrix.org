The best place to get information and connect is on Matrix itself - starting in
[Matrix HQ (#matrix:matrix.org)](https://matrix.to/#/#matrix:matrix.org) or in the [Office of the Matrix.org Foundation (#foundation-office:matrix.org)](https://matrix.to/#/#foundation-office:matrix.org).

However, if you prefer email, or have a need to be more direct:

- [abuse@matrix.org](mailto:abuse@matrix.org) if you need to urgently report
  abuse on the platform
- [support@matrix.org](mailto:support@matrix.org) for more general support and
  commercial queries
- [security@matrix.org](mailto:security@matrix.org) to disclose security issues.
  Also see our [Security Disclosure Policy](/security-disclosure-policy/)

You can find our staff members, and contact details for some of them, in the [About](/about/) section.
