### How to use them

- **Link it back:** If you display a badge on your site, we encourage you to link the image to our [Members Page](@/foundation/members/index.md). This helps verify your support and helps others discover the Foundation.
- **Visual Integrity:** Please do not stretch, rotate, or modify the colors of the badges. Do not alter the aspect ratio of the badge.
