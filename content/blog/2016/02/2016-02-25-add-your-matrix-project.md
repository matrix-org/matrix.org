The <a href="http://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html">try-matrix-now</a> page is now being generated by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">jekyll</a> and all the project pages have been moved to the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/tree/master/supporting-docs/projects">matrix-doc</a> project on github.

The idea is to make it very easy for anyone to add or update a project entry. All you need to do is to submit a PR with the project details; feel free to start with the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/master/supporting-docs/projects/template.md">template</a>, and you can also add images (thumbnail and/or a main picture for the project page) to the images subfolder (just use the same relative URL that is in the template). Any kind of project using Matrix is welcome; if you are unsure which category to use, just use "other".

Jekyll requires a date in the project filename; we use the date to sort the various project lists (newest projects first). It might be best to submit new entries with a date like 2015-01-01.
