<img src="/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/V.png" alt="Vector" width="20%" height="20%" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1698" /> Vector Android has been added to the <a href="https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=im.vector.alpha">F-Droid catalogue</a>. F-Droid is an installable catalogue of FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) applications for the Android platform. Many people have asked or requested Vector to be added to F-Droid, so we are happy to be able to announce its inclusion.

In order to meet the requirements for F-Droid, the build is not using GCM (Google Cloud Messaging) for notifications - instead it will keep syncing in the background. If you find that the ongoing background sync is using too much battery, you can add a delay or change the timeout of the sync - or even disable background sync completely - in the settings page.

Finally, if you have feedback on any of the Vector clients, there is <a href="https://vector.im/beta/#/room/#vector-feedback:matrix.org">#vector-feedback:matrix.org</a>.
