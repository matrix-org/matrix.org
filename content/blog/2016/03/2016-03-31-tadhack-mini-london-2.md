It's soon time for the 2nd <a href="http://tadhack.com/2016/mini-london/">TADHack-mini London</a>. The event starts at 10am on Saturday April 9th and hacking continues until the projects are pitched, starting at 1pm on Sunday April 10th. As you can see by the <a href="/blog/posts/?s=tadhack">many previous TADHacks</a>, every hackathon brings interesting and impressive projects, so we are again expecting great things!

As usual, there are great prizes to be won - worth around $5k in total. This time, we will award the best Matrix-related hack a <a href="http://www.trossenrobotics.com/phantomx-ax-hexapod.aspx">PhantomX AX Metal Hexapod Mark III</a> from Trossen Robotics, a build-it-yourself hexapod robot kit! The robot is built on an entirely open source platform, complete with 3D cad models of the robot, open software, and schematics for the electronics.
