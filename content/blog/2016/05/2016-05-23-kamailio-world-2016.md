Last week I went to <a href="https://www.kamailioworld.com/k04/">Kamailio World 2016</a> in Berlin to meet fellow VoIP-developers and tell them all about Matrix. It's a fairly small conference, which is actually quite nice as it means you get to talk to almost everyone. A lot of people were interested in Matrix - both new and familiar faces - in fact, some of them heard about Matrix <a href="/blog/2015/06/01/matrix-wins-most-entertaining-demo-at-kamailio-world/">a year ago at Kamailio World 2015</a> and were interested in hearing what progress we've made since.

As always, Matrix participated in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkjIIh0cqcM&t=9m">James Body's dangerous demos session</a> - and I also gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oV4WHaCJh2k">30min talk on Matrix and recent updates</a> to a full room on the first day of the conference.

Several people mentioned that Matrix could be interesting to their project, either as a glue between services, or for adding text-based chat to VoIP apps. I hope to see some of you in Matrix at some point - please join us in <a href="https://vector.im/beta/#/room/#matrix:matrix.org">#matrix:matrix.org</a> and say hi! It's also a good place to ask questions and discuss how Matrix can work with your project. Auf Wiedersehen!
