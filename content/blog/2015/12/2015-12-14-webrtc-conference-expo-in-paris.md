Daniel and myself are catching the Eurostar tomorrow afternoon, and the conference will start early Wednesday morning with a panel about WebRTC for Mobile, where Daniel is one of the participants.

I'm sure we will have three days full of interesting talks and discussions (see the <a href="http://www.uppersideconferences.com/webrtc/webrtc_2015_program_day_1.html">full schedule here</a>). There will be demos as well, and Matrix is (of course!) also joining the demo competition. We hope to see many familiar faces - and hopefully meet some new ones as well!

If you are going to the conference, please come and say hello â€“ we will have a stand at the expo (we're table #6 - see <a href="http://www.uppersideconferences.com/webrtc/webrtc_2015_expo_sponsoring.html">map here</a>). And don't miss Daniel's Matrix One-year Status Report at 11.10am on Friday!

See you there!
