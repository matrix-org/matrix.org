The Android Matrix Console app has been updated to v0.4.4, and now supports voice and video calling! Get it now from the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.matrix.androidsdk.alpha">Google play store</a>!

In addition to the new voice and video support, and all the related call management, this release includes:
<ul>
 <li>One-tap "autocomplete": clicking on a displayname inserts that into the message box</li>
 <li>Click on any (textual) event to copy its content</li>
 <li>The app can now be installed either in device memory or on the SD card</li>
 <li>Notifications can be enabled per room</li>
 <li>Fix for an edge-case where messages could be duplicated</li>
 <li>Fixed several reported issues/crashes - for the full list look at the CHANGES files in the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-console/blob/master/CHANGES.rst">console</a> and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.rst">SDK</a> projects</li>

</ul>
