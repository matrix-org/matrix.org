This weekend was spent at <a href="http://www.idea-london.co.uk/" title="IDEA-London">IDEA-London</a> where the <a href="tadhack.com/2015/tadhack-mini-london" title="TADHack-mini London">TADHack-mini London</a> hackathon was going on. In total, there were around 18 different projects being hacked on all day Saturday and Sunday morning, before a 5-minute presentation on Sunday afternoon.

Four different projects used Matrix in one way or another: Matrixbot - a robot controlled through standard messages in a Matrix room - done by Scott Barstow and Anders Brownworth (project <a href="https://github.com/scottbarstow/tadhackLondon2015" title="code">code</a> and presentation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvDIkqyxnac" title="video">video</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/587253016463564801" title="picture">picture</a>). Neil Stratford's hack included lighting up his roll of LEDs whenever a push-notification hit his Matrix webclient (<a href="https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/587262829390123009" title="picture">picture</a> from the presentation).

The Co-Browsify hack by Žilvinas Račyla and Augustinas Bacvinka allows two people to browse the same webpage, with scrolling events being collected and duplicated to the other browser via Matrix (<a href="https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/587272083106848768" title="picture">picture</a> from the presentation). Finally, Matt Williams of Metaswitch created a Project Clearwater/Matrix Gateway which enables Project Clearwater/IMS to set up WebRTC calls with any matrix user (project <a href="https://github.com/matt-williams/sprout/tree/matrix" title="code">code</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/587269326899654656" title="pictures">pictures</a> from the presentation) - this is the first time we have had a SIP-to-Matrix call (let alone IMS-to-Matrix) set up!

As TADHack sponsors, Matrix had two Parrot Drones to hand out as prizes, and the winners for best Matrix-related hacks are Matt Williams for the Clearwater/Matrix Gateway -  and Scott Barstow and Anders Brownworth for Matrixbot! We are also happy that the other two Matrix-related projects were rewarded with prizes from the other sponsors (<a href="http://blog.tadhack.com/2015/04/12/tadhack-mini-london-winners/" title="full list of winners">full list of winners</a>).

All in all it was a very productive weekend, both in terms of tech and also meeting people. Thanks to everyone who participated and especially those who worked on Matrix-related hacks!
