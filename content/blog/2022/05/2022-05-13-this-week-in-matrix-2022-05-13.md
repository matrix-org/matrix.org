## Dept of Spec 📜

[Andrew Morgan (anoa)](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io) says

> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals>.
>
> ## MSC Status
>
> **New MSCs:**
>
> * [[WIP] MSC3815: 3D Worlds](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3815)
> * [[WIP] MSC3814: Dehydrated devices with SSSS](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3814)
> * [MSC3813: Obfuscated events](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3813)
>
> **MSCs with Proposed Final Comment Period:**
>
> * _No MSCs had final comment period proposed this week._
>
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
>
> * [MSC3787: Allowing knocks to restricted rooms](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3787) (merge)
>
> **Merged MSCs:**
>
> * _No MSCs were closed this week._
>
> **Closed MSCs:**
>
> * [MSC3790: Register Clients](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3790)
>
> ## Spec Updates
>
> The Spec Core Team has decided to not include [MSC3440](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440) (threading via `m.thread` relations) specifically in the upcoming Matrix v1.3 release. We previously stated that it would be in v1.3, but there's a few unproven MSCs (namely [MSC3773](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3773) (notifications for threads)) which make it feel improper to put threads into the spec at this stage. We're aiming for a future (very near) spec release to contain threads, assuming we can get enough of the feature landed. This is a very similar approach to what we did with Spaces: while the core feature existed as FCP-concluded for a while, we wanted to give some other MSCs a chance to land before writing it up formally.
>
> As a follow-on from this, any implementations that are currently assuming "v1.3" spec support translates to threading support should note the following:
>
> * Clients which are pre-emptively checking for v1.3 in `/versions` should stop doing that. Look for `org.matrix.msc3440.stable` as an "unstable" feature flag instead.
> * Servers which offer MSC3440's behaviour should expose it on stable endpoints and expose `org.matrix.msc3440.stable` for clients to detect.
> * Optionally, clients and servers can drop support for the `org.matrix.msc3440` (truly unstable) flag, given clients & servers should have already upgraded.
>
> At the spec level, we'll still be writing up MSC3440's dependencies (aggregations and friends), but will notably be missing MSC3440 specifically in v1.3. If folks can update their clients urgently, it would be massively appreciated!
>
> ## Random MSC of the Week
>
> The random MSC of the week is... [MSC2596: Proposal to always allow rescinding invites](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2596)!
>
> A simple change to the auth rules to help prevent an edge case where one is able to invite a user, but not disinvite them as the latter requires a separate permission. The MSC attempts to solve this by always allowing the cancellation of invitations you've sent.
>
> A small MSC, but one with some open threads still. Perhaps a good opportunity to go in and clean it up!

## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Synapse ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/))

Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team

[squah](https://matrix.to/#/@squah:matrix.org) says

> Hello everyone. This week the team cut a [release candidate for Synapse v1.59](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.59.0rc1), which includes:
>
> * New module API support for [editing push rules](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12406).
> * Experimental support for [MSC3266, federated room summary](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11507) and [MSC3786](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12601).
> * Updates to support for [MSC2285, hidden read receipts](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2285).
> * Many bug fixes and internal improvements!
>
> Meanwhile, the core team has looking at caches and memory usage: Erik has been looking at ways to reduce the memory usage of small servers, Shay's been adding some exciting [new config options to limit the total memory usage of Synapse](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12701) and David's added the ability to [reload the cache factors of a running Synapse instance via SIGHUP](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12673).
>
> In parallel, Olivier's been doing groundwork to reduce replication traffic for workerised Synapse deployments, Andrew (anoa) has been looking at media retention policies and work continues on faster room joins.

### Dendrite ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite))

Second generation Matrix homeserver

[neilalexander](https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:dendrite.matrix.org) reports

> This week we've actually made two releases — [Dendrite 0.8.4](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.8.4) and [Dendrite 0.8.5](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.8.5) — which are both primarily targeting performance and bug fixes.
>
> We've also released our new living documentation, which is available at <https://matrix-org.github.io/dendrite/>, which features new installation instructions and documents that will be helpful to Dendrite server administrators. We will be writing more documentation and expanding this over time.
>
> Changes include:
>
> * The built-in NATS Server has been updated to version 2.8.2
> * Monolith deployments will no longer panic at startup if given a config file that does not include the `internal_api` and `external_api` options
> * State resolution v2 now correctly identifies other events related to power events, which should fix some event auth issues
> * The latest events updater will no longer implicitly trust the new forward extremities when calculating the current room state, which may help to avoid some state resets
> * The one-time key count is now correctly returned in `/sync` even if the request otherwise timed out, which should reduce the chance that unnecessary one-time keys will be uploaded by clients
> * The `create-account` tool should now work properly when the database is configured using the global connection pool
> * Fixes a regression introduced in the previous version where appservices, push and phone-home statistics would not work over plain HTTP
> * Adds missing indexes to the sync API output events table, which should significantly improve `/sync` performance and reduce database CPU usage
> * Building Dendrite with the `bimg` thumbnailer should now work again (contributed by [database64128](https://github.com/database64128))
>
> As always, feel free to join us in [#dendrite:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org) for more Dendrite-related discussion.

[alphapapa](https://matrix.to/#/@alphapapa:matrix.org) announces

> [Ement.el](https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el), a Matrix client for [GNU Emacs](<https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs>], received some more updates this week:
>
> _Additions_
>
> * New [Transient](https://github.com/magit/transient)-based command menu for room buffers, bound to `?`.
> * New command `ement-list-members`, which lists all members in a room.

> * Power-level events are displayed.
> * Grouped membership events have tooltips showing each member's individual event.
> * When usernames are colorized, message bodies may optionally be colorized in a less intense shade of the same color, so they are easily distinguished yet easy on the eyes (and, of course, the shading is customizable).
>
> _Changes_
>
> * When displaying usernames in the margin, names that are wider than the margin are abbreviated, with the full name in the tooltip.
>
> _Fixes_
>
> * Typing notifications (recently broken--oops!).
> * Sending direct messages marks new direct rooms as direct rooms.
> * Event notifications for rooms not displayed in a buffer.

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰

### matrix-rust-sdk ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk))

Matrix Client-Server SDK for Rust

[ben](https://matrix.to/#/@gnunicorn:matrix.org) reports

> The Rust Matrix team is very excited to announce the next major release [**Matrix SDK 0.5 "stores and native crypto"**](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/releases/tag/matrix-sdk-0.5.0), now available for everyone by adding `matrix-sdk  = "0.5.0"` to their dependencies in their `Cargo.toml`. This first major release in about 8 months brings significant changes many have been waiting for:
>
> * **Better, safer, native-er crypto**: matrix-sdk 0.5 ditches libolm in favor of Vodozemac, the completely fresh rust-native re-implementation of the crypto crate. It has also been audited, the report of which is scheduled to be released soon.
> * **Store revamp**: the entire cache storage infrastructure for crypto and state has been restructured to allow for full plug-ability, with even the two default supported backends, [sled](https://crates.io/crates/matrix-sdk-sled) and [indexeddb](https://crates.io/crates/matrix-sdk-indexeddb) both being separate crates now. And as a matter of fact, a community-driven [sql implementation has already been published as beta](https://crates.io/crates/matrix-sdk-sql) (with postgres and sqlite support) by [charlotte 🦝](https://matrix.to/#/@lotte:chir.rs).
> * **WebAssembly**; both of these changes also allow us to finally make WASM a Tier 1 supported target for the SDK. Not only does it build and even use the browser native indexeddb for permanent storage, we also have CI tests ensuring nothing will break this support going forward.
> * **Features, Features and Process**: there's plenty more features and bug fixes in this release, e.g. native thumbnail generation support, as well as changes on our processes going forward.
>
> **For more details, [check out the Release Notes](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/releases/tag/matrix-sdk-0.5.0)**.
>
> _Sidenote_: If you want to contribute, or just learn Rust by actually doing it, we recommend taking [a look team at the `help wanted` issues](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) in our repo.

## Dept of Bots 🤖

### Who's In This Room Matrix Bot

[Jake C](https://matrix.to/#/@jake:jakecopp.chat) says

> If you use Matrix with the Signal bridge (or any bridge) with relay mode
> enabled, your guests have probably experienced the confusion where they don't know who else (on Matrix) is in the chat as only Matrix can double-puppet.
>
> When this bot is added to a Matrix room, it will announce:
>
> * Who the room members are when a new Signal user joins;
> * When a Matrix user joins or leaves, who that Matrix user was.
>
> I built it just this afternoon using the excellent `matrix-bot-sdk`, but it's in Typescript and has plentyful unit tests!
>
> I don't currently have a public bot, but if anyone is interested please join [#whos-in-this-room-bot-discussion:jakecopp.chat](https://matrix.to/#/#whos-in-this-room-bot-discussion:jakecopp.chat) and say hello!
