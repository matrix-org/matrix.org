## Dept of *Status of Matrix* 🌡️

[Thib](https://matrix.to/#/@thib:ergaster.org) says

> Taking my GNOME Foundation hat on for this news: the GNOME Foundation is adopting Matrix! Is this TWIM worthy? It probably wouldn't have been if it wasn't for all the great work of Gwmngilfen! We published a joint blog post (though in all fairness Greg did all the heavy lifting) to explain how the decision was taken, and transparently share the data we had at hand.
>
> In practice that means after *years* of Matrix being around in the GNOME community and being the most popular platform, it's finally moving out of the grey zone of "everyone is using it but some older contributors really like their current set up, so it exists but it's not officially our primary platform". For now we're keeping both our Matrix instance and the bridge to GIMPnet (the IRC network GNOME people have been using for years). The major change is that IRC is now our legacy, so if tradeoffs have to be made Matrix will keep the premium experience.
>
> Again, huge shout out to Gwmngilfen who gave meaning to the data I handed to him.

## Dept of Spec 📜

[Andrew Morgan (anoa)](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io) reports

> ### Spec
>
> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals>.
>
>
> #### MSC Status
>
> **New MSCs:**
>
> * [MSC3784: Using room type of `m.policy` for policy rooms](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3784)
> * [MSC3783: Fixed base64 for SAS verification](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3783)
>
> **MSCs with Proposed Final Comment Period:**
>
> * [MSC3244: Room version capabilities](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3244)
>
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
>
> * *No MSCs are in FCP.*
>
> **Merged MSCs:**
>
> * *No MSCs were merged this week.*
>
>
> #### Spec Updates
>
> Hello again everyone! Your regularly-scheduled TWIM Spec update has returned, along with graph-based media!
>
> Quick news to point out this week is that a new maubot plugin has been written to simply note the details of MSCs after their IDs ("msc1234") have been posted in a room. The bot supports multiple MSC IDs in a message, message edits, threads and end-to-end encrypted rooms.
>
> A copy of the bot is currently running under `@mscbot:matrix.org`, so feel free to invite it to a room if you'd find that useful!
>
> #### Random MSC of the Week
>
> The random MSC of the week is... [MSC3216: Synchronized access control for Spaces](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3216)!
>
> This MSC serves as an alternative to [MSC2962](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2962), and essentially allows for user permissions to be simultaneously enforced across a set of rooms in a Space. This would allow functionality to users of platforms like Discord, where a user can be a moderator in a guild, and thus in all of that guild's channels.

## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Synapse ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/))

Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team

[richvdh](https://matrix.to/#/@richvdh:sw1v.org) says

> A few operational issues have taken up quite a bit of the team's time this week, but we've still found time to cut a couple of [release candidates of v1.58](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.58.0rc2).  Highlights include:
>
> * Locked python dependencies for our Docker images and Debian packages, thanks to David's [poetry work](https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/54).
> * Some big performance fixes, including [an optimisation to login](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12365) from Erik and one to [message backfill](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/12522) from yours truly.
>
> We're also excited to see quite a few contributions from outside the core maintenance team: thanks to [Dirk](https://github.com/dklimpel), Beeper, Famedly and everyone else in the community who has made pull requests!
>
> Meanwhile on the core team, Sean has been continuing to lay groundwork for faster room joins, and Olivier has been doing some exciting work so that we will (finally) be able to test Synapse in worker mode under Complement.

### Dendrite ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite))

Second generation Matrix homeserver

[neilalexander](https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org) says

> This week we announced [Dendrite 0.8.2](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.8.2) with a bunch of usability fixes. As always, join us in [#dendrite:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org) for more discussion and updates.
>
> #### Features
>
> * Lazy-loading has been added to the `/sync` endpoint, which should speed up syncs considerably
> * Filtering has been added to the `/messages` endpoint
> * The room summary now contains "heroes" (up to 5 users in the room) for clients to display when no room name is set
> * The existing lazy-loading caches will now be used by `/messages` and `/context` so that member events will not be sent to clients more times than necessary
> * The account data stream now uses the provided filters
> * The built-in NATS Server has been updated to version 2.8.0
> * The `/state` and `/state_ids` endpoints will now return `M_NOT_FOUND` for rejected events
> * Repeated calls to the `/redact` endpoint will now be idempotent when a transaction ID is given
> * Dendrite should now be able to run as a Windows service under Service Control Manager
>
> #### Fixes
>
> * Fictitious presence updates will no longer be created for users which have not sent us presence updates, which should speed up complete syncs considerably
> * Uploading cross-signing device signatures should now be more reliable, fixing a number of bugs with cross-signing
> * All account data should now be sent properly on a complete sync, which should eliminate problems with client settings or key backups appearing to be missing
> * Account data will now be limited correctly on incremental syncs, returning the stream position of the most recent update rather than the latest stream position
> * Account data will not be sent for parted rooms, which should reduce the number of left/forgotten rooms reappearing in clients as empty rooms
> * The TURN username hash has been fixed which should help to resolve some problems when using TURN for voice calls (contributed by [fcwoknhenuxdfiyv](https://github.com/fcwoknhenuxdfiyv))
> * Push rules can no longer be modified using the account data endpoints
> * Querying account availability should now work properly in polylith deployments
> * A number of bugs with sync filters have been fixed
> * A default sync filter will now be used if the request contains a filter ID that does not exist
> * The `pushkey_ts` field is now using seconds instead of milliseconds
> * A race condition when gracefully shutting down has been fixed, so JetStream should no longer cause the process to exit before other Dendrite components are finished shutting down

## Dept of Bridges 🌉

## Dept of Non Chat Clients 🎛️

### Thirdroom ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/thirdroom))

A browser-based open metaverse client

> * Added: The room lists now have external matrix.to links.

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰

### Ruma ([website](https://ruma.dev/))

A set of Rust library crates for working with the Matrix protocol. Ruma’s approach to Matrix emphasizes correctness, security, stability and performance.

[Jonas Platte](https://matrix.to/#/@jplatte:flipdot.org) announces

> Our last update included the words "if things go to plan", and even though that's usually calling for trouble, not so this time!
> We released Ruma 0.6.0 yesterday and apart from a tiny missing feature that was fixed and released as 0.6.1 today, everything went smooth 🙂
>
> The biggest breaking changes are
>
> * new owned identifier types – calling `.to_owned()` on `&UserId` now gives you an `OwnedUserId` instead of `Box<UserId>`
> * a new event enum hierarchy, where redacted events are better taken into account
>
> Also, with this release we can now claim practically 100% coverage of Matrix v1.2, that is you can send and receive requests for all specified endpoints of the various APIs, as well as send and inspect all specified event types, all with a strongly-typed Rust API.

## Dept of Ops 🛠

### matrix-docker-ansible-deploy ([website](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy))

Matrix server setup using Ansible and Docker

[Slavi](https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com) reports

> Thanks to [Aine](https://gitlab.com/etke.cc) of [etke.cc](https://etke.cc/), [matrix-docker-ansible-deploy](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy) can now set up [the Buscarron bot](https://gitlab.com/etke.cc/buscarron). It's a bot you can use to send any form (HTTP POST, HTML) to a (encrypted) Matrix room

### Buscarron ([website](https://gitlab.com/etke.cc/buscarron))

Web forms (HTTP POST) to matrix

[Aine](https://matrix.to/#/@aine:etke.cc) reports

> the Miounne's successor is here - meet Buscarron!
>
> There were no news about miounne for a while because we worked on a new "iteration" that can handle matrix encryption (thanks to the [mautrix-go](https://github.com/mautrix/go)).
>
> So, here is it - Buscarron v1.0.0 with e2e encryption and multiarch (arm32, arm64, amd64) support. It can handle any HTTP POST/HTML form and send it to a (encrypted) matrix room. Of course, Buscarron has small neat features like spam checker and rate limiter.
>
> [etke.cc](https://etke.cc/) is migrating to Buscarron and deprecating Miounne.
>
> Go check out the [source code](https://gitlab.com/etke.cc/buscarron) and say hi in the [#buscarron:etke.cc](https://matrix.to/#/#buscarron:etke.cc)

## Dept of Bots 🤖

### Location streams bot for MSC3489

### Opsdroid ([website](https://github.com/opsdroid/opsdroid))

An open source chat-ops bot framework

[Cadair](https://matrix.to/#/@cadair:cadair.com) says

> [Opsdroid 0.26](https://github.com/opsdroid/opsdroid/releases/tag/v0.26.0) has been released this week. Included in this release are some improvements to the Rasa NLU parser if you want natural language training for your matrix bots as well as some small documentation improvements to the matrix connector and other bug fixes. Big thanks to Oleg for many of the changes as well as all the other contributors.

### Matrix Community Manager ([website](https://gitlab.com/Sleuth56/Matrix-Community-Manager/))

The highly configurable message aggregation and filtering bot for matrix!

[Sleuth](https://matrix.to/#/@sleuth:rexrobotics.org) reports

> Matrix Community Manager has seen some work in the features department over the past week.
>
> With the new Ansible playbook I think it's possible for someone with a bit of Ansible experience to get this bot up and running in under 10 minutes. I did a fresh install in 4 minutes. That is a fresh VPS and creating a new matrix account. Instructions for the Ansible deploy can be found [here](https://sleuth56.gitlab.io/Matrix-Community-Manager/Installation-With-Ansible/).
>
> The major features are:
>
> * An Ansible playbook that should simplify the installation process for new users.
> * Edits to the message that triggered the bot will now be reflected in the bots message. This bot now has a feature Twitter doesn't have :laughing:.
> * Hashtags are now called filters. Filters are more customizable allowing for custom delimiters and now show the originating room.
> * The AutoJoin feature has filters to control who or from where invites will be excepted.
> * Announcements can have more than one output room. Using a comma separated list of room ids.
>
> A few bugs were fixed as well:
>
> * Some text characters were causing messages to be classed incorrectly thus causing crashes.
> * Exotic characters specifically in links were causing crashes.
>
> Come chat on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#Matrix-Community-Manager:matrix.org)
