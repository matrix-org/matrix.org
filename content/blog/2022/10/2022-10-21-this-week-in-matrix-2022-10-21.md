This week 

## Dept of *Status of Matrix* 🌡️

[Gwmngilfen](https://matrix.to/#/@gwmngilfen:matrix.org) reports

> [AnsibleFest 2022](https://www.ansible.com/ansiblefest) happened this week, and the work the community has been doing with Matrix got quite some attention! We got a mention during [the Day 1 Keynote (YouTube)](https://youtu.be/9MzDVfE0TC0?list=PLbMP1JcGBmSGISjo4iR3fveO2q2PmjJrg&t=1817) and again during [an interview](https://www.thecube.net/events/red-hat/ansiblefest-2022/content/Videos/0e8cec23-d195-4692-8a98-c9a8e2dee7b4) with theCUBE.net. Both are worth watching 🙂
> 
> Thanks to the shoutout from Adam in the Keynote, we've had 40 new people join the [#social:ansible.com](https://matrix.to/#/#social:ansible.com) room 🚀 and lots of interest in Matrix at the Fest Community Booth. Huge thanks to @maxamillion:one.ems.host and @cybette:ansible.im for their time! ❤️

## Dept of Spec 📜

[Andrew Morgan (anoa)](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io) says

> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals.
> 
> ## MSC Status
> 
> **New MSCs:**
> 
> * [MSC3914: Matrix native group call push rule](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3914)
> * [MSC3912: Relation-based redactions](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3912)
> * [MSC3911: Linking media to events](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3911)
> * [MSC3910: Content tokens for media](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3910)
> 
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
> 
> * [MSC3905: Application services should only be interested in local users](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3905) (merge)
> 
> **Closed MSCs:**
> 
> * [MSC3005: Streaming Federation Events](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3005)
> * [MSC2775: Lazy loading over federation](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2775)
>     - Superseded by [MSC3706](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3706) and [MSC3902](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3902).
> 
> **Accepted MSCs:**
> 
> * _No MSCs were accepted this week._
> 
> ## Spec Updates
> 
> The Spec Core Team are continuing to work on spec maintenance in the run up to Matrix v1.5 (due next month!). Again, if you'd like to help out with small fixes and corrections to the spec, feel free to take a look at the [list of open spec clarification issues](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aclarification+sort%3Aupdated-desc). Thank you!
> 
> ## Random MSC of the Week
> 
> The random MSC of the week is... [MSC2700: Thumbnail requirements for the media repo](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2700)!
> 
> This MSC has the goal of clarifying the [mimetypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type) of media that a homeserver both MUST and SHOULD support thumbnailing for. The intention is to give clients a clearer picture of what file formats will receive a proper thumbnail before they are uploaded to the homeserver.
> 
> Comments on the MSC seem to suggest that the MSC as it stands does not completely solve the problem: while it does give clients an explicit list of supported mimetypes, the list is quite short. And the list of SHOULD mimetypes cannot be relied on.
> 
> The MSC also clarifies that encrypted media should always be uploaded with a mimetype of `application/octet-stream`, instead of the original media's mimetype, which seems like a welcome and uncontentious point. And finally, it defines `501 M_UNSUPPORTED` to be returned instead of an internal server error on thumbnailing failure.
> 
> I believe the next step for this MSC is for the current threads to be incorporated into the text; so don't miss the threads when reading it!

## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Synapse ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/))

Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team

[Brendan Abolivier](https://matrix.to/#/@babolivier:element.io) announces

> This week we've released Synapse 1.69! It comes with improved caching tools for third-party modules, and support for a bunch of experimental features, such as thread-aware read receipts ([MSC3771](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3771)) and an approval flow for new registrations ([MSC3866](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3866)). As part of this release, we've also laid out the removal schedule for the long-deprecated legacy Prometheus metric names, and the `generate_short_term_login_token` module API method. Read all about it on the matrix.org blog: https://matrix.org/blog/2022/10/17/synapse-1-69-released
> 
> Another big thing in Synapse 1.69 is experimental support for faster remote room joins! You can read more about it on the blog: https://matrix.org/blog/2022/10/18/testing-faster-remote-room-joins but briefly, we are ready for server admins to begin testing, with some caveats. If you've read the post and feel confident, turn it on, give it a spin and let us know how it goes!
> 
> Alongside 1.69, we're also disclosing a moderate severity vulnerability that we fixed back in Synapse 1.62. If your deployment runs a Synapse version older than 1.62, and is openly federating, please update to a more recent version of Synapse at your earliest convenience. More info on this in advisory [GHSA-jhjh-776m-4765](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-jhjh-776m-4765) and [CVE-2022-31152](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2022-31152).
> 
> This week we've also released the first release candidate for Synapse 1.70 ([1.70.0rc1](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.70.0rc1)). This release will include experimental support for thread-aware notifications ([MSC3773](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3773)) and filtering ([MSC3874](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3874)), improved validation, advertising support for Matrix 1.3 and 1.4, and the usual load of bugfixes and internal improvements. We're very grateful to anyone helping us make Synapse more stable by testing and running release candidates, and reporting bugs to [the issue tracker](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=BUG_REPORT.yml) and general feedback to [#synapse:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#synapse:matrix.org) 🙂

### Dendrite ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite))

Second generation Matrix homeserver

[neilalexander](https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org) announces

> This week we released [Dendrite 0.10.4](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.10.4) which contains the following features and fixes:
> 
> * Various tables belonging to the user API will be renamed so that they are namespaced with the `userapi_` prefix
>   * Note that, after upgrading to this version, you should not revert to an older version of Dendrite as the database changes **will not** be reverted automatically
> * The backoff and retry behaviour in the federation API has been refactored and improved
> * Private read receipt support is now advertised in the client `/versions` endpoint
> * Private read receipts will now clear notification counts properly
> * A bug where a false `leave` membership transition was inserted into the timeline after accepting an invite has been fixed
> * Some panics caused by concurrent map writes in the key server have been fixed
> * The sync API now calculates membership transitions from state deltas more accurately
> * Transaction IDs are now scoped to endpoints, which should fix some bugs where transaction ID reuse could cause nonsensical cached responses from some endpoints
> * The length of the `type`, `sender`, `state_key` and `room_id` fields in events are now verified by number of bytes rather than codepoints after a spec clarification, reverting a change made in Dendrite 0.9.6
> 
> As always, please feel free to join us in [#dendrite:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org) for more related discussion.

## Dept of Bridges 🌉

### matrix-hookshot ([website](https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-hookshot))

A multi purpose multi platform bridge, formerly known as matrix-github

[Andrew F](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewf:element.io) reports

> matrix-hookshot [2.4.0](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/releases/tag/2.4.0) is here with yet more features!
> 
> Good news everyone. This release adds improved JIRA & GitHub event support. Here are some highlights:
> 
> * Multiple JIRA connections may now be added to a single room (as well as across multiple rooms).
> * JIRA widgets now properly support adding listeners for issue creation -- a small bug prevented it from working last release.
> * JIRA widgets now support adding listeners for issue updates. This was technically already supported, but it wasn't shown in the widget -- now it's there for the world to see.
> * JIRA connections now support version events. So far, this includes version creation, updates, and releases.
> * GitHub connections now support workflow completion events.
> * The stability of GitHub login sessions has been improved overall.
> 
> As usual, feel free to join [#hookshot:half-shot.uk](https://matrix.to/#/#hookshot:half-shot.uk) for setup advice & feedback.

[gleachkr](https://matrix.to/#/@gleachkr:matrix.org) says

> It's been a little while since our last update, but Populus development continues! In addition to the usual bugfixes, we've made a number of ergonomics improvements suggested by the experiences of other users at my university. These include:
> 
> 1. Buttons for message actions (react, redact, reply, and so on) are now displayed in a way that doesn't overlap with sender names
>    
>    
> 2. Avatar images for discussions can now up uploaded simultaneously with discussion creation.
>    
>    
> 3. Older collections of discussions can be "archived" using `m.lowpriority`
>    
>    
> 4. Moar tootips!
>    
>    
> 
> We've also made some minor graphical improvements: loading messages are now indicated with a nice low-contrast SVG hint, rather than the literal-minded "loading message" message. Some icons have been improved, and the bartab (lines in the margins) display logic has been improved. And, we're now on the latest JS-SDK version.

[ben](https://matrix.to/#/@gnunicorn:matrix.org) announces

> While the [sliding sync extensions](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1054) are being tested and bugs found during the tests reported and fixed, the [FFI for the new timeline API](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1106) has been approved and merged this week. The third big chunk that was merged this week, was a refactoring to [Replace QR with SAS verification](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1098) and the yet to be merged [signaling for SAS verification](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1124). 
> 
> While forcing the (not clearly spec'ed) sending of authentication tokens for [`get_profile`](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1120) and [`get_display_name`](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1118), we've also noticed a bug where we sometimes, unintentionally include the access_token in debug output - [and fixed that](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1130). We will be providing a patch release and RustSec about this soon.
> 
> Other than that, this week has seen many smaller fixes, like [making the store-setters on client-builder actually adhere to the builder pattern](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1131) or [removing string from storerrors](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1119), and improvements like the [API to set local trust](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1126)  or setting workspace wide dependencies for [uniffi](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1116) and [others](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1122).
