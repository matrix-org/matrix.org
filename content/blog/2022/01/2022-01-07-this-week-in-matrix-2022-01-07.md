## Matrix Live 🎙

What a pleasure it is to be back with the community for the new year! This week Erlend is detailing what Commune is, and I'm flabbergasted by how well thought-through the project is.

## Dept of we've been away for holidays

This week in Matrix should be called Three Weeks in Matrix, since there hasn't been TWIM updates during the holiday season. [Nico](https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev) has published a [first](https://blog.neko.dev/posts/bootleg-twim.html) and [second communitwim](https://blog.neko.dev/posts/inofficial-twim-2021-12-31.html) while I was away. All the news reports since the last official TWIM still made it to the post you're currently reading!

> ## Spec Core Team
> In terms of Spec Core Team MSC focus for ~~this week~~ the last little bit, we've been working on getting MSCs merged into the formal spec itself in preparation for v1.2 this quarter. We expect the release to happen quite soon and to contain [Spaces](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3610), [room versions 8 and 9](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3387), and [refresh tokens](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2918) (no spec PR yet) in addition to all the other wonderful stuff which has landed.
> 
> The merged MSCs can be seen over at [https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/](https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/) where they're queued up for the next release. Look out for `Added in v1.2` labels throughout the spec, denoting what is new and exciting.
> 
> ## Random MSC of the week
> 
> The random MSC this week is [MSC2192: Inline widgets](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2192) (I promise it was random, after a few re-rolls). Inline widgets are a concept that allows for rich functionality in the timeline without needing to necessarily specify an explicit event type. For example, video embeds, minigames, etc could all be represented by inline widgets instead of dedicated event types.
> 
> The MSC needs updating to handle [MSC1767: Extensible Events](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1767) (and friends), but once there it could be a very powerful bit of functionality, with free fallback thanks to Extensible Events.

[Kegan](https://matrix.to/#/@kegan:matrix.org) announces

> Sliding sync (aka sync v3) is described in [MSC3575](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3575) - it's still very early days for the proposal which means a lot can change: and YOU can be a part of that. Please take a look at the MSC and provide any and all feedback, be it on the names of keys, format of JSON objects, or the kinds of operations that can be performed. I'm particularly interested in feedback from client developers who have complex room list sort orders or room list filtering requirements and bot/bridge developers who typically don't have a visible room list UI. Any and all feedback at this stage is welcome, visit [#sliding-sync:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#sliding-sync:matrix.org) to join the discussion.

## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Synapse ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/))

> We're back! New year, new release candidate: we published [Synapse 1.50.0rc1](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.50.0rc1) today, marking the end of life for our Python 3.6 and PostgreSQL 9.6 support. We've also extracted some shared utilities into their own package, [matrix-common](https://pypi.org/project/matrix-common/), which is used by Synapse, Sygnal, and Sydent.
> 
> We'll talk more about what's in 1.50 next week when it formally releases.
> 
> The Synapse team is expecting to spend most of January on behind-the-scenes work as we gear up to virtually host FOSDEM again!

### matrix-media-repo ([website](https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo))

Matrix media repository with multi-domain in mind.

[TravisR](https://matrix.to/#/@travis:t2l.io) says

> ~~[v1.2.9](https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo/releases/tag/v1.2.9)~~ [v1.2.10](https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo/releases/tag/v1.2.10) got released as a maintenance update. With early support for Matrix 1.1, S3 storage classes, and blurhash fixes it's worth the upgrade though there are other goodies - check out the changelog, and report bugs to the issue tracker 🙂

## Homeserver Deployment 📥️

### Helm Chart ([website](https://gitlab.com/ananace/charts))

Matrix Kubernetes applications packaged into helm charts

[Ananace](https://matrix.to/#/@ace:kittenface.studio) reports

> And as a end-of-year update, [my Helm Charts](https://gitlab.com/ananace/charts) have gotten updated yet again. With element-web ending up on 1.9.8, matrix-synapse on 1.49.2 (and .1 before that), and matrix-media-repo on 1.2.10

### Dendrite Helm Chart ([website](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/charts/tree/master/charts/incubator/dendrite))

## Dept of Bridges 🌉

### Matrix Webhook Receiver ([website](https://github.com/HarHarLinks/matrix-webhook-receiver))

An add-on for the matrix-appservice-webhooks bridge. Webhooks are essentially web interfaces for applications to "push" data to. The bridge can receive messages in a certain format, which is nice if the notifying app can be configured. Often it cannot.

[kim](https://matrix.to/#/@kim:sosnowkadub.de) says

> [matrix-webhook-receiver](https://github.com/HarHarLinks/matrix-webhook-receiver) has hit 1.1.0!
> Give feedback or talk to us about it over in [#matrix-webhook-receiver:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-webhook-receiver:matrix.org)! 🙂
> 
> ### Features
> * [Advanced Templating](https://github.com/HarHarLinks/matrix-webhook-receiver#advanced-templating)! It is now possible to set `format` and `msgtype` based on arbitrary values from the webhook JSON via Jinja2. Shoutout to **qg** for suggesting this and giving their feedback!
> * compatibility with matrix-appservice-webhooks forks that read `avatarUrl` instead of `avatar_url`
> * allow mxc:// URL avatars
> * improvements to the GUI, including automatically resizing text areas and msc:// avatar URL preview
> * improvements to templates/examples including making use of above features
> * more documentation, including [Tips & Tricks](https://github.com/HarHarLinks/matrix-webhook-receiver#tips--tricks) and [Related Projects](https://github.com/HarHarLinks/matrix-webhook-receiver#related-projects)
> 
> ### Notable Fixes
> * ability to properly set no avatar
> * work around [upstream's newline issue](https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-appservice-webhooks/issues/97) when not using a template
> 
> **Full Changelog**: https://github.com/HarHarLinks/matrix-webhook-receiver/compare/1.0.0...1.1.0

### matrix-hookshot ([website](https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-hookshot))

A multi purpose multi platform bridge, formerly known as matrix-github

[Half-Shot](https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk) says

> Howdy folks, it is the time of the year where everyone scarpers! Anyway, perfect time to announce that **matrix-hookshot has gotten it's first major release!**. 1.0.0 is here!
> 
> For those not in the know, the hookshot bridge is used to bridge GitHub, GitLab, JIRA and Generic Webhooks into Matrix rooms. It doesn't just bridge into existing rooms, but can also spawn dynamic rooms based on aliases, send you your notifications in a DM and do lots of other wonderful things!
> 
> The notable changes from the 0.1.0 release are:
> 
>    - The bridge has now been renamed from matrix-github to matrix-hookshot.
>    - Now supports JIRA and Generic Webhooks in addition to GitHub and GitLab.
>    - Includes new commands and metrics reporting.
>    - Includes [complete documentation](https://half-shot.github.io/matrix-hookshot).
> 
> You can get involved and start playing with it by checking out the release [here](https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-hookshot/releases/tag/1.0.0)
> 
> And that will be my last TWIM entry of the year. Have a good one and stay safe all 🐶

That was in 2021! [Half-Shot](https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk) is back in 2022 with more news

> Hey folks! It was only last year we released the 1.0 release of hookshot, after many years of work to get it that far. I'm happy to announce that this week we've got [another release](https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-hookshot/releases/tag/1.1.0). There are a number of buxfixes and improved documentation pieces landing (special shoutout to HarHarLinks for ensuring the docs are competent). The highlights are as follows:
> * Added support for Figma webhooks. this also means the archival of my old project [matrix-figma](https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-figma)
> * Support GitLab wiki page change events.
> * Added a new script `validate-config` which allows you to check your config file for simple errors. Handy for people writing ansible roles!
> * Add support for a html key on generic webhooks to set the HTML content of a Matrix message.
> 
> The project can be found over at https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-hookshot/, with pretty pretty docs at https://half-shot.github.io/matrix-hookshot. We're also in [#hookshot:half-shot.uk](https://matrix.to/#/#hookshot:half-shot.uk) if you prefer using Matrix to learn about these things!

### Heisenbridge ([website](https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/))

Heisenbridge is a bouncer-style Matrix IRC bridge.

[hifi](https://matrix.to/#/@hifi:vi.fi) announces

> Heisenbridge roundup!
>
> Release ~~v1.8.0~~ ~~v1.8.1~~ ~~v1.8.2~~ v1.9.0 🥳
> * Spaces support 🌃
> * Sort NAMES reply nicks 🔤
> * `UNPLUMB` network command to force unplumbing without being in the room
> * Proper SASL external with CertFP with mechanism override option (see notes)
> * Disconnect and cleanup from networks that have no rooms open ♻️
> * Reply (and reject) DM requests to ghosts with `QUERY` command ↪️
> * Try to keep IRC users in the room at all costs if they are on the IRC channel
> * Fix assumption of all IRC replies to have arguments
> * Prevent accidental namespace changes to cause mayhem
> * Finally convert from homegrown Matrix API stuff to Mautrix
> * Bump Mautrix requirement to 0.12=>0.14
> * Conduit support was broken in 1.8.x but fixed again in 1.9.0, sorry
> 
> Finally there's network level spaces support with a new `SPACE` command. This creates a new bridge controlled space for the network and automatically manages rooms in and out. There's an issue/feature with Element that all rooms that have been converted to DMs with `/converttodm` will appear in all bridge spaces. The workaround is to convert them back to regular rooms.
> 
> CertFP SASL has been updated to do SASL external flow by default. If you are upgrading and have used CertFP with OFTC you need to run `SASL --mechanism=none` for it to connect again.
> 
> Abandoned networks where the user has left all rooms including the network room will now automatically disconnect and cleanup. This is more in line what people would expect and prevents idle connections from hanging around.
> 
> Get your third vaccination from [GitHub](https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/releases), [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/heisenbridge/) or [matrix-docker-ansible-deploy](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy)!

> Thanks!

## Dept of Clients 📱

### Nheko ([website](https://nheko-reborn.github.io))

Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.

[Nico](https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev) announces

> We just released 0.9.1!
> 
> This is a small bug fix release. If you reported an issue, there is a 15% chance it is fixed now! This release also supports pinned messages, although those will only show up after someone changed the pinned messages in a room currently (we didn't want to force a full resync just for such a small feature). The spaces list is also now nested, Nheko offers you quick access to your recently used reactions and Nheko will show you your direct chats in the sidebar. Apart from that there are quite a few bugfixes and smaller improvements, you can find the full changelog and downloads here: https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/releases/tag/v0.9.1
> 
> Thank you everyone, who helped shape this release!

[Nico](https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev) reports

> Nheko now is a lot more efficient. We now use one Threadpool instead of 3, got rid of more than 60% of the allocations when scrolling through messages, layout half as much content when scrolling, blurhashes decode in 10% of the time and jdenticons allocate ~10% as much temporary buffers. We also deleted around 1000 lines of unused code. Tooltips also shouldn't steal the mouse focus when scrolling anymore, which could lead to sudden stalls when scrolling.
> 
> Additionally edits now replace existing notifications, tastytea added a manpage and fixed blurry or incorrectly sized custom emoji, you can now send custom emotes via the inline completer using ~ and completers now show a scrollable list with more Elements than before. Advanced users can also now opt into an insecure client side secrets storage via a hidden setting.

[Nico](https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev) says

> We're baaaaack! Anyway, last week Drake just translated all of Nheko into Spanish, you can now zoom in and pan in the image viewer, emojis shouldn't split up into their segments anymore and Nheko should always be sending the qualified version of it (according the to the unicode test files, not by just appending FE0F). Blurhashes should be even faster still and we now have support for running the call event loop on macOS and Windows (although call support is still disabled there for now). 
> 
> We are also now working to restructure our README. It has a lot of outdated stuff in it and you really want to see screenshots pretty early in the README! You can sneak a peak here: https://nheko.im/nheko-reborn/nheko/-/tree/README_updates

### matrix-bot-sdk ([website](https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-bot-sdk))

A TypeScript/JavaScript SDK for Matrix bots

[TravisR](https://matrix.to/#/@travis:t2l.io) announces

> [matrix-bot-sdk](https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-bot-sdk) has had a v0.6.0-beta.3 release with beta support for crypto! It even includes documentation!
> 
> The crypto is considered beta quality at the moment: good enough to use for somewhat unimportant bots, but not fully recommended for production just yet. With that being said, I'm interested in bugs you run into - please use the issue tracker if you run into crypto not working.
> 
> Tutorials for the crypto setup are at https://turt2live.github.io/matrix-bot-sdk/tutorial-encryption.html
> 
> Note for appservice support to work then you'll need a Synapse with these PRs enabled (may require manual merge too):
> * https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11538
> * https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11617
> * https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11215
> 
> For non-linux platforms, the rust-sdk will try to build itself which means you might need a working Rust stack. The Rust SDK repo itself has more information: 
> * https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/blob/travis/node-bindings/crates/matrix-sdk-crypto-nodejs/README.md
> * https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/blob/travis/node-bindings/README.md
> 
> Bots and appservices don't automatically support encryption, but adding encryption *should* be easy. The Rust SDK dependency is required in either case, sorry.

### Complement ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/complement))

### Polyjuice ([website](https://gitlab.com/polyjuice))

Elixir libraries related to the Matrix communications protocol.

[uhoreg](https://matrix.to/#/@hubert:uhoreg.ca) reports

> [Polyjuice Newt](https://gitlab.com/polyjuice/polyjuice_newt), the newest addition to the Polyjuice project, is an Elixir binding for [vodozemac](https://github.com/matrix-org/vodozemac/), the new Olm/Megolm implementation in Rust.  At the time of writing, Polyjuice Newt supports encryption and decryption using Olm and Megolm, but by the time you read this next year, it may also support the SAS verification functions and pickling/unpickling.

### NixOS Deployment ([website](https://nixos.org))

Matrix packaging for NixOS

[piegames](https://matrix.to/#/@piegames:matrix.org) announces

> I don't think we've previously had any [Nix/NixOS/nixpkgs](https://nixos.org) related entries in TWIM, so I'll start ^^
> 
> The current unstable channel has extended its Matrix ecosystem support to also include [Heisenbridge](https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge) and [Conduit](https://conduit.rs/) packages and modules. This makes it super easy to deploy any of those services: For example, my configuration for Heisenbridge is 21 lines long, and Conduit is only 11 lines. You can browse the available configuration options online: [`services.matrix-conduit`](https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=unstable&query=services.matrix-conduit), [`services.heisenbridge`](https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=unstable&query=services.heisenbridge) (note that some of them are freeform and simply forward to the upstream configuration).
> 
> For those that are not into NixOS, a module is the code that turns the declarative configuration files into your running system setup. As an example, if you enable `services.heisenbridge` the following things are done for you:
> 
> * Create a new `heisenbridge` user and group for the service
> * Create and manage the registration file for the homeserver (i.e. automatically regenerate it after the configuration changed)
> * Create a systemd service that runs the `heisenbridge` command with the requested bridge configuration. The unit also sets a few systemd security hardening options.
> 
> For support, join our Matrix space at [#community:nixos.org](https://matrix.to/#/#community:nixos.org) and its Matrix-Nix channel: [#matrix-nix:transformierende-gesellschaft.org](https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-nix:transformierende-gesellschaft.org)

### matrix-docker-ansible-deploy ([website](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy))

Matrix server setup using Ansible and Docker

[Slavi](https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com) says

> Thanks to [Aine](https://gitlab.com/etke.cc) of [etke.cc](https://etke.cc/), [matrix-docker-ansible-deploy](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy) can now help you set up [Honoroit](https://gitlab.com/etke.cc/honoroit) - a helpdesk bot.
> 
> See our [Setting up Honoroit](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/docs/configuring-playbook-bot-honoroit.md) documentation to get started.

[Slavi](https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com) says

> Thanks to [Aine](https://gitlab.com/etke.cc) of [etke.cc](https://etke.cc/), [matrix-docker-ansible-deploy](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy) now supports [Cinny](https://cinny.in/) - a new simple, elegant and secure Matrix client.
> 
> To try it out, see our [Setting up Cinny](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/docs/configuring-playbook-client-cinny.md) documentation page.

[Slavi](https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com) announces

> At [matrix-docker-ansible-deploy](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy), we believe that 2022 will be the year of the non-Synapse Matrix server!
> 
> [Jip J. Dekker](https://github.com/Dekker1) did the [initial work](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/pull/818) of adding [Dendrite](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite) support to the playbook back in January 2021. Lots of work (and time) later, Dendrite support is finally ready for testing.
> 
> The playbook was previously quite [Synapse](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse)-centric, but can now accommodate multiple homeserver implementations, with Synapse still remaining the default.
> 
> To learn more, see [our changelog entry about Dendrite](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#dendrite-support).

[Slavi](https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com) announces

> Thanks to [Matthew Cengia](https://github.com/mattcen) and [Shreyas Ajjarapu](https://github.com/shreyasajj), [matrix-docker-ansible-deploy](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy) can now bridge to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) using the [mautrix-twitter](https://github.com/mautrix/twitter) bridge. 
> 
> Note: the playbook already supports another Twitter bridge - [mx-puppet-twitter](https://github.com/Sorunome/mx-puppet-twitter).
> 
> To get started with this bridge, see [Setting up Mautrix Twitter bridging](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/docs/configuring-playbook-bridge-mautrix-twitter.md) in our documentation.
> 
> This brings the total number of bridges supported by the playbook up to 22. See all supported bridges [here](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/docs/configuring-playbook.md#bridging-other-networks).
