## Matrix Live 🎙

{{ youtube_player(video_id="2HMolgFVkO0") }}

## Dept of Spec 📜

[anoa](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz) reports

> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals>.
>
> ## MSC Status
>
> **New MSCs:**
>
> * [MSC3664: Pushrules for relations](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3664)
> * [\[WIP\] MSC3662: Allow Widgets to share user mxids to the client](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3662)
> * [MSC3659: Invite Rules](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3659)
> * [\[WIP\] MSC3647: Bring Your Own Bridge - Decentralising Bridges](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3647)
>
> **MSCs with proposed Final Comment Period:**
>
> * [MSC2781: Remove the reply fallbacks from the specification](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2781)
> * [MSC3030: Jump to date API endpoint](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3030)
> * [MSC3589: Room version 9 as the default room version](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3589)
>
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
>
> * _No MSCs are in FCP._
>
> **Merged MSCs:**
>
> * [MSC3567: Allow requesting events from the start/end of the room history](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3567)
> * [MSC2675: Serverside aggregations of message relationships](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2675)
>
> ## Spec Updates
>
> Work on preparing the release of Matrix v1.2 is currently underway. As of today, the Spec Core Team is aiming for a release of Matrix v1.2 on **February 2nd**.
>
> If you know of any MSCs which you believe should be included in Matrix v1.2, but haven't started/finished Final Comment Period yet, please bring them up in the [#sct-office:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org), and we'll take a look. Thanks!
>
> ## Random MSC of the Week
>
> The random MSC of the week is... [MSC3635: Early Media for VoIP](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3635)!
>
> When I first came across this MSC, I didn't know what "Early Media" as a concept referred to. Even after skimming the MSC... I still didn't really know. But I'll demystify it here in case it peaks your interest and you would like to learn more.
>
> Early media is essentially any media that is exchanged between the moment you start a call, to the moment the other side picks up (a connection is established). For instance, the ringing you hear while waiting for someone to pick up (called "ringback tones"), or the "busy" tone you hear when the line is busy. Those audio bits are known as "early media". Video can also fall into this category (though that's less common).
>
> This MSC would essentially allow Matrix to introduce these concepts in Matrix-only calls (though these days the client just plays sounds while connecting), but more crucially would allow Matrix to interoperate with other protocols (like SIP) that expect to handle these features.
>
> So yay, more interoperability and bridge compatibility!

## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Synapse ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/))

Synapse is the reference homeserver for Matrix

[callahad](https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org) says

> After a somewhat bumpy process, we [released Synapse 1.50](https://matrix.org/blog/2022/01/18/synapse-1-50-released) on Tuesday! The big thing you need to be aware of is that we're turning off support for Python 3.6 and PostgreSQL 9.6, including Linux distributions which ship with those versions by default (like Ubuntu 18.04 LTS). Please make sure your infrastructure is up-to-date.
>
> I'm personally very excited that we tracked down [a bug](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11729) which could cause device list updates to get lost when being sent over federation. When device lists fall out of sync, it can cause failures when attempting to decrypt messages, since the keys may not have been sent to all of the user's devices.
>
> We've also made quite a lot of progress in allowing Application Services to support end-to-end encryption via the still-experimental [MSC3202](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3202).
>
> For MSCs which _have_ been merged into the Matrix Spec, we now implement [MSC3419](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3419), allowing guests to send state events into rooms, and we now use stable identifiers for cross-signing and fallback keys per [MSC1756](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1756) and [MSC2732](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2732).
>
> Looking to the future: We're aiming to release 1.51 next week so it has plenty of time to burn in before we host [FOSDEM 2022](https://fosdem.org/2022/). This is a pretty quick turnaround from 1.50, but we'll return to our usual fortnightly release cadence for subsequent releases. To that end, [1.51.0rc1](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.51.0rc1) is out today; give it a shot. 😉

### Conduit ([website](https://conduit.rs))

Conduit is a simple, fast and reliable chat server powered by Matrix

[Timo ⚡️](https://matrix.to/#/@timokoesters:fachschaften.org) announces

> Hello again! In the last week we continued to optimize the rocksdb backend and Conduit in general, trying to get it as memory efficient as possible. Using valgrind we could see that memory was not getting released in some cases.
>
> We found out that switching to the `jemalloc` allocator completely got rid of this problem and memory usage seems to be a lot more stable now!
>
> All of this is currently available on the `next` branch. We are preparing to make a v0.3.0 release soon!
>
> Join [#conduit:fachschaften.org](https://matrix.to/#/#conduit:fachschaften.org)  to help us test it.
>
> Thanks to everyone who supports me on [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/timokoesters) or Bitcoin!

## Homeserver Deployment 📥️

### Helm Chart ([website](https://gitlab.com/ananace/charts))

Matrix Kubernetes applications packaged into helm charts

[Ananace](https://matrix.to/#/@ace:kittenface.studio) announces

> And back to regular form, my [Helm Charts](https://gitlab.com/ananace/charts) have gotten some upgrades again; element-web got upgraded to 1.9.9, and matrix-synapse got both 1.50.0 and 1.50.1 (the configuration generated by the chart shouldn't be affected by the .0 bug, but always good to upgrade)

## Dept of Clients 📱

### Watch The Matrix ([website](https://github.com/pixlwave/Watch-The-Matrix))

[Danielle](https://matrix.to/#/@daniellekirkwood:one.ems.host) announces

> **Threads**
>
> * To keep your timeline clean and ordered we’ll soon be introducing threaded messages to Element. Currently the team is working hard on the fallback solution, and polishing up the user interface.
>     * Threads is already in Labs on Web, so go ahead and check it out!
>     * For mobile, we’re hoping to release Threads to Labs in the next few weeks.
>
> **Polls**
>
> * Get ready to start asking more questions… Polls are nearly ready to go! You’ll be able to ask folks things like; their favourite superhero, which day you should grab lunch, or even the best way to make tea (milk first, always). ☕️
>     * If you just can’t wait ‘til we’re ready to launch, you can enable Polls from Labs.
>
> **Location Sharing**
>
> * Location sharing is almost here! You’ll soon find a new setting to turn this on, which will give you the location sharing icon in your composer and can be used to tell people exactly where you are!
>     * The setting will be in the next release on iOS and Android, and will start “off” by default. Once the feature is settled in, we’ll turn it on by default.
>
> **Community testing**
>
> * Join [#element-community-testing:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#element-community-testing:matrix.org) to help out with the testing
> * We will be testing the FOSDEM conferencing setup (Element web + widgets) on Monday at 17:00 UTC
> * Element Desktop (Nightly) has had an Electron update, join us to test it on Tuesday at 16:00 UTC

### Element Web/Desktop ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-web))

### Element iOS ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-ios))

Secure and independent communication for iOS, connected via Matrix. Come talk with us in [#element-ios:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#element-ios:matrix.org)!

[Danielle](https://matrix.to/#/@daniellekirkwood:one.ems.host) says

> * The integration of analytics tracking has been included in the most recent version of the app. Using PostHog Analytics we’ll be able to make informed product decisions for our app as we’ll have more visibility into the usefulness of each feature.
>     * Remember; Analytics is opt-in and you don’t have to share any info with us. If you choose to opt-in we’ll start to learn how users use Element and how we can simplify your experiences.
>
> **In development:**
>
> * Work ongoing on Spaces support, finished improving [room long press interactions](https://github.com/vector-im/element-ios/issues/5232) for Spaces and reviews of [space creation](https://github.com/vector-im/element-ios/issues/5224) changes are nearing completion. Work ongoing on [Space settings](https://github.com/vector-im/element-ios/issues/5233).
> * We’re currently building a simplified first time user experience, the first piece of which will be released in the next few weeks!
> * The team is working to update to Xcode 13 / iOS 15.

### Element Android ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-android))

[Danielle](https://matrix.to/#/@daniellekirkwood:one.ems.host) reports

> * We’ve had some trouble with the stability of our releases this week but the team’s been working hard to get it all ironed out. Our latest update to the app store fixes some bugs and includes the option to enable analytics.
>     * Analytics? Yes! Knowing how our users traverse our app, and understanding this cross-platform, will help us to tailor to your needs and make impactful improvements. If you don’t want to send anonymised event info to Element, no problem! Just say no. If you change your mind, there’s a toggle in Settings.
>
> **In development:**
>
> * Message Bubbles? Yes, please! With a week of successful testing internally we’re nearly ready to release message bubbles into the wild. We’re excited to see what you think.
> * Element’s first time user experience could use a little help, so the team have been working on improvements to our sign up flow that will _hopefully_ reduce confusion for newbies.

## Dept of Non Chat Clients 🎛️

>
> The tool gracefully supports room aliases, message edits, custom templates (check the `contrib/` dir for example) and 2 export modes - single (all messages exported to a single file) or multi (each message exported to separate file, that's how etke.cc/news works)
>
> [Source code](https://gitlab.com/etke.cc/emm)

A Matrix helpdesk bot

[Aine](https://matrix.to/#/@aine:etke.cc) reports

> long time no see! Today I come with a new internal [etke.cc](https://etke.cc/) tool that publicly available, because open source matters.
>
> Honoroit is a helpdesk matrix bot with end-to-end encryption support, that utilizes [MSC3440 (Threading)](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440/) to act as a proxy between a customer (any matrix user) and your backoffice (users added in special room), each customer's room = thread in a backoffice room, where multiple operators can send messages to the same customer at once.
>
> Pretty bad description, I know - check the source code to see screenshots.
>
> Updates:
>
> * the v0.9.2 release brings the fallback reply-to mode, so even on matrix clients that doesn't support threads yet you can use it with good ol' replies.
> * the v0.9.3 release fixes commands parsing in the reply-to mode and adds prefixes to the thread topics

## Dept of Guides 🧭

[Éibhear (on matrix.org)](https://matrix.to/#/@eibhear:matrix.org) reports

> Hi TWIM. I published a long-planned, long-in-the-making, long-winded [report](https://www.gibiris.org/eo-blog/posts/2022/01/21_containterise-synapse-postgres.html) of how I containerised my _matrix-synapse_ homeserver and its _PostgreSQL_ database in order to get ahead of the application dependency deprecations. This was something I couldn't find for myself, so I put this together to help anyone else who might need it. (And it **does** contain a TL;DR section!)

[Helder Ferreira](https://matrix.to/#/@helder:helderferreira.io) says

> I’ve created [blog post|(https://helderferreira.io/matrix-well-known-with-cloudflare/) explaining the way to host the static well-known files using cloudflare workers gaining speed and stability

## Matrix in the News 📰

[Brendan Abolivier](https://matrix.to/#/@babolivier:element.io) says

> During the holidays I recorded a podcast about Matrix and Element with AnDaolVras/La Cantine Brestoise, which is a French non-profit organising tech events and operating a coworking space in Brest, France. The episode (in French, sorry!) came out on Monday and can be found [on their website](https://www.lacantine-brest.net/22-brendan-abolivier-element-de-la-matrix/), on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ASr1TUHqZQM) as well as on most podcast platforms 🙂
