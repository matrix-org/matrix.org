## Dept of Spec 📜

[TravisR](https://matrix.to/#/@travis:t2l.io) reports

> Hey all, it's been a holiday for much of the team this week, so from the plane of Maple trees I present to you the spec update.
>
> The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals>
>
> ## MSC Status
>
> **Merged MSCs:**
>
> * [MSC3604: Room Version 10](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3604)
>
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
>
> * [MSC3816: Clarify Thread Participation](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3816) (merge)
>
> **New MSCs:**
>
> * [MSC3828: Content Repository CORP Headers](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3828)
> * [MSC3827: Filtering of `/publicRooms` by room type](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3827)
>
> ## Spec Core Team
>
> In terms of Spec Core Team MSC focus for this week, we've been working on getting Matrix 1.3 out the door and generally working towards a better process for handling releases alongside critical proposals for the protocol. The goal is to be able to ship these major features while reducing the risk of a release falling behind. Watch this space for more details as this should result in MSCs getting through the process a little bit quicker.
>
> For Matrix 1.3, we're targeting **Thursday, June 16th, 2022** as our release date, though this comes with a small asterisk: we're looking to land quite a lot of stuff so might have to adjust the date once more as needed. We do feel reasonably confident in the date though - watch for blog posts titled Matrix 1.3 in the coming weeks.
>
> ## Random MSC of the week
>
> The script has chosen [MSC2846 - Decentralizing media through CIDs](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2846) as your random MSC this week. The MSC raises an interesting question about how to make media more akin to events in Matrix. If you're interested in this area, take a read of it and the related MSCs.

[Till](https://matrix.to/#/@s7evink:matrix.org) reports

> This week we released [Dendrite 0.8.7](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.8.7)! This is a **highly recommended** update since it fixes some fairly large bugs:
>
> * Support added for room version 10
> * A number of state handling bugs have been fixed, which previously resulted in missing state events, unexpected state deletions, reverted memberships and unexpectedly rejected/soft-failed events in some specific cases
> * Fixed destination queue performance issues as a result of missing indexes, which speeds up outbound federation considerably
> * A bug which could cause the `/register` endpoint to return HTTP 500 has been fixed
>

### Element Call ([website](https://call.element.io))

Native Decentralised End-to-end Encrypted Group Calls in Matrix, as a standalone web app

[Matthew](https://matrix.to/#/@matthew:matrix.org) reports

> We've had breakthroughs this week on implementing a native Matrix SFU (selective forwarding unit) which speaks [MSC3401](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3401), thanks to [Sean DuBois](https://siobud.com/) - all round WebRTC superstar, project lead for the [Pion](https://github.com/pion/webrtc) WebRTC implementation for Go, and author of [WebRTC for the curious](https://webrtcforthecurious.com/).
>
> Sean generously contributed an initial proof of concept to show how you'd build an MSC3401 SFU using Pion at <https://github.com/matrix-org/sfu-to-sfu> - which (I think?) is the first time that the first implementation of a major core MSC has been contributed from outside the core team.  Huge thanks to Sean to setting the ball going on this - the current PoC demonstrates not just SFU capability but also the decentralised cascading architecture which makes MSC3401 unique. The initial PoC speaks a 'test jig' version of MSC3401 hooked up to a simple web client for experimentation, but Matthew's now experimenting with adding [genuine Matrix support](https://github.com/matrix-org/sfu-to-sfu/pull/10) to it via mautrix-go, and [hooking up Element Call](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/pull/2423) to speak to it.
>
> Adding SFU support to Element Call will mean that we can support more than ~7 simultaneous calls - and with MSC3401-style decentralised cascading, we should be able to support hundreds or even thousands. There's lots of work remaining here, but the ball is now rolling.  For more info about SFUs and MSC3401, check out Matthew's [CommCon 2021 talk](https://2021.commcon.xyz/talks/extending-matrix-s-e2ee-calls-to-multiparty) (which was what prompted Sean's implementation work here!)
>
> Separately, we've been running Element Call on staging with E2EE enabled for the last few weeks, and should be releasing the first major Element Call update next week.  And once SFUs land, then Element Call can exit beta - watch out Zoom!

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰

### libolm ([website](https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm))

[uhoreg](https://matrix.to/#/@hubert:uhoreg.ca) announces

> libolm 3.2.12 has been released.  The main update in this release is that the `olm_sas_calculate_mac_fixed_base64` is now exposed in all the official bindings, so that [MSC3783](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3783) can be implemented.  Aside from that, there have been some minor fixes and improvements.  See the [changelog](https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm/-/releases/3.2.12) for more information.

### matrix-rust-sdk ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk))

Matrix Client-Server SDK for Rust

[ben](https://matrix.to/#/@gnunicorn:matrix.org) says

> While most of the work in the background continues (Sliding-Sync PoC, Wasm+NodeJS support, UniFFI macros), the first few parts surface through the cracks and show themselves in new PRs:  [basic wasm web-js and nodejs support has landed](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/675) with [more APIs](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/721), tests and documentation on the way; the [Sliding Sync PoC](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/728) has been upgraded to the latest JSON layout and now provides a first set of reactive API via FFI, too. Furthermore this week has seen a bunch of [cleanups](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/716), [simplifications](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/717) and [clarifications](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/712) around the OlmMachine and crypto types, and we're [fixing a bug in the state store](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/729), where not all data has been properly encrypted in the past.

### Matrix Dart SDK ([website](https://github.com/famedly/matrix-dart-sdk))

Matrix SDK written in pure Dart and maintained by [Famedly](https://famedly.com/)

[Henri Carnot](https://matrix.to/#/@henri_carnot:famedly.de) announces

> Dart Matrix SDK : Version 0.9.9
>
> This week, the team released [version 0.9.9](https://pub.dev/packages/matrix/versions/0.9.9). In this new version, we added a search function to allow searching for an event in database and on server through several requests to the `/messages` endpoint.
>
> There was also some work on updating the image size when generating thumbnail, which allow saving a bit of calculation when sending events. If using a custom resizer make sure to update the resize response as [here](https://github.com/famedly/matrix-dart-sdk/-/snippets/2342277).
>
> We also did some refactor with the event sender getter. The getter result is now a future to allow requesting the member event to the server if we cannot find it in memory, to help fix the issue when the user was not found in memory.
>
> Finally, a quick helper function (`client.waitForSync`) was added. It allows you to wait for a room to appear in (left, join, invited) section of the sync response.
>
> See you next time ;)

## Dept of Bots 🤖

### Matrix Community Manager ([website](https://gitlab.com/Sleuth56/Matrix-Community-Manager/))

The highly configurable message aggregation and filtering bot for matrix!

[Sleuth](https://matrix.to/#/@sleuth:rexrobotics.org) announces

> Only a small update this week. One new feature and some much needed Ansible improvements.
>
> Pipes move messages from one room to an other. Useful if you are in important rooms but only want to monitor a single room.
> The Ansible role can now manage more aspects of MCM. Mainly in the post setup phase. The major one being if you run into encryption errors for any reason you can run the playbook with the fix tag and it will generate you a new device ID and encryption store.
>
> * Pipes move all messages from one room to an other.
> * Adding a filter now uses the room the command was sent from by default if the roomid is not specified.
> * Ansible role now has tags for start, stop, configs, fix and all.
> * Ansible role backs up the configuration.toml file to prevent the possibility of data loss.
