## Dept of Spec 📜

[Andrew Morgan (anoa)](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io) says

> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals>.
>
> ## MSC Status
>
> **New MSCs:**
>
> * _There were no new MSCs this week._
>
> **MSCs with Proposed Final Comment Period:**
>
> * [MSC2832: HS -> AS authorization header](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2832)
> * [MSC3715: Add a pagination direction parameter to `/relations`](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3715)
>     * FCP was proposed earlier, but all concerns have been cleared this week.
>
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
>
> * _No MSCs are in FCP._
>
> **Accepted MSCs:**
>
> * [MSC3816: Clarify Thread Participation](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3816)
>
> ## Spec Updates
>
> The release date for Matrix v1.3 has been set in stone for Thursday, June 16th 2022! Expect a blog post on the day detailing all of the new additions.
>
> The bot that posts MSC updates in [#matrix-spec:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-spec:matrix.org) and elsewhere has been switched from @mscbot:amorgan.xyz to @mscbot:matrix.org. The backend of the bot uses <https://github.com/Informo/specs-bot/>.
>
> ## Random MSC of the Week
>
> The random MSC of the week is... [MSC2000: Server-side password policies](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2000)!
>
> This is a proposal that adds a mechanism for homeserver administrators to define a password policy for users. This policy can decide rules such as a minimum password length, whether a digit is required, etc. This policy can be enforced by the homeserver when a user registers an account or changes their account password and is communicated to the client so that it can also be enforced locally.
>
> Astute readers will possibly note that authentication in Matrix will eventually be replaced by OAuth2 ([MSC2964](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2964)). This will move operations like password policy enforcement from the homeserver to a separate authentication service, essentially removing the need to reinvent-the-wheel in a homeserver.
>
> Registration, login and managing passwords and connected third-party IDs is often a complex part of a Matrix homeserver. Moving these out to a separate authentication service will both unlock new features (log in with Matrix!) as well as reduce the resources required to implement a Matrix homeserver.

## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Synapse ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/))

Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team

[Shay](https://matrix.to/#/@shayshay:matrix.org) says

> Work continues on speeding up federated room joins, improving testing, and reducing database i/o. In addition, some lovely features have been added:
>
> * Add new media\_retention options to the homeserver config for routinely cleaning up non-recently accessed media.
>
> * Experimental support for MSC3772: Push rule for mutually related events.
>
> * Update to the check\_event\_for\_spam module callback: Deprecate the current callback signature, replace it with a new signature that is both less ambiguous (replacing booleans with explicit allow/block) and more powerful (ability to return explicit error codes).
>
> * Add storage and module API methods to get monthly active users (and their corresponding appservices) within an optionally specified time range.
>
> * Support the new error code ORG.MATRIX.MSC3823.USER\_ACCOUNT\_SUSPENDED from MSC3823.
>
> * Add a configurable background job to delete stale devices.
>
> * Improve URL previews for pages with empty elements.
>
> * Allow updating a user's password using the admin API without logging out their devices. Contributed by @jcgruenhage.
>
> This is in addition to quite a number of bugfixes!

### Dendrite ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite))

Second generation Matrix homeserver

[neilalexander](https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org) says

> This week we released [Dendrite 0.8.8](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.8.8), which contains the following improvements:
>
> * The performance of state resolution has been increased significantly for larger rooms
> * A number of changes have been made to rate limiting:
>     * Logged in users will now be rate-limited on a per-session basis rather than by remote IP
>     * Rate limiting no longer applies to admin or appservice users
>     * It is now possible to configure additional users that are exempt from rate limiting using the `exempt_user_ids` option in the `rate_limiting` section of the Dendrite config
> * Setting state is now idempotent via the client API state endpoints
> * Room upgrades now properly propagate tombstone events to remote servers
> * Room upgrades will no longer send tombstone events if creating the upgraded room fails
> * A crash has been fixed when evaluating restricted room joins
>
> As always, please feel free to join us in [#dendrite:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org) for more discussion.

## Dept of Clients 📱

### FluffyChat ([website](https://fluffychat.im))

[Krille Fear](https://matrix.to/#/@krille:janian.de) says

> FluffyChat 1.5.0 goes Material You
>
> FluffyChat 1.5.0 has been released and will soon be in all stores. This release comes with a bunch of bugfixes and introduces the first iteration of a Material You based design. We also try to support Android 12 accent colors (while this does not seem to work yet). On other platforms, our own purple shape will stay the default.
>
> I like the new Material You design while we needed to tweak it at some points. Also the dropdown menu misses some elevation but this is a known issue in the Flutter repo which will be fixed soon.
>
> This is also the first build with Flutter 3 which should improve the performance a little bit. Unfortunately it brings some regressions. We are forced to ship a little bug with it: Sharing on iPads seems to be broken. I'm very unhappy with this situation but otherwise we would have ended up in different releases for different platforms. As there afaik are not that many iPad users out there, we decided to live with this compromise and ship a bugfix release asap.
>
> Yeah... Flutter has a lot of pros but also a lot of cons. Every new release of this framework leads to the fear of new regressions. Shipping a new major release where basic stuff like "Sharing" is just broken, is totally stupid... but that's the decision of Google. :-P
>
> We didn't want to wait to ship the new design and also we needed a new release to come back to F-Droid where FluffyChat wasn't available in the last weeks because of a ProGuard problem, which should be fixed now.

## Dept of VoIP 🤙

### Element Call ([website](https://call.element.io))

Native Decentralised End-to-end Encrypted Group Calls in Matrix, as a standalone web app

[Florian Heese](https://matrix.to/#/@fheese:element.io) reports

> **Element Call Beta 2**
>
> This week we landed Element Call beta 2 (<https://call.element.io>) including a bunch of nice updates. First of all, everything is now end-to-end encrypted by default: not only the WebRTC streams but also the matrix signaling (It was consciously disabled in beta 1 for debugging purposes). Moreover, we have experimental support for spatial audio rendering. Give it a try — you can find it in the settings section. It's a lot of fun to play with and really supports immersion during a video call. This release also introduces a whole new experimental way of communicating: Walkie-talkie mode. In that mode, videos are disabled, and everyone is muted by default. To speak, press the ‘push-to-talk’ (PTT) button — takes me back to my childhood 🙂

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰

### Matrix Dart SDK ([website](https://github.com/famedly/matrix-dart-sdk))

Matrix SDK written in pure Dart and maintained by [Famedly](https://famedly.com/).

[Henri Carnot](https://matrix.to/#/@henri_carnot:famedly.de) announces

> Version 0.9.12
>
> This week, the team released [version 0.9.12](https://pub.dev/packages/matrix/versions/0.9.12). In this version, we updated our Matrix API Lite package, in which we fixed the issue with the room hierarchy endpoint with some improper parsing and wrong type coming from the generation of the spec Open API documentation.
>
> We also did some housekeeping and renamed some methods and getter to make them explicit. For example, the `futureSender` getter is now an asynchronous method called `fetchEventSender()` to make it clear that calling this function may trigger an API call.
>
> Possibility to override the  supported Matrix spec version but we don't really recommend using it for production.
>
> See you next time ;)

## Dept of Internet of Things 💡

[cvwright](https://matrix.to/#/@cvwright:matrix.org) reports

> Here's a fun Matrix-based project for you, sponsored by yours truly and my employer [FUTO](https://futo.org/).
>
> The "Golden Tiger" senior capstone project team at Portland State University just delivered the results of two quarters's design and implementation work on a secure/private, self-hostable, end-to-end encrypted cloud security camera using Raspberry Pi's and Matrix.  The idea of this prototype project was to provide similar functionality to commercial services like Ring or Nest, but without letting any nosy third party see inside (or around) your home.
>
> The students' code is available on Github in two repos:
>
> * [The in-home Raspi camera controller](https://github.com/Open-Source-Videos/Matrix-surveillance-camera-controller)
> * [The React/Cordova frontend](https://github.com/Open-Source-Videos/Matrix-surveillant-camera-security-web)
