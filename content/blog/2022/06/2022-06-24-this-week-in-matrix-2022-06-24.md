## Matrix Live üéô

This week was very busy and we unfortunately didn't have the time to record a Matrix Live. Everything will be back to normal next week!

## Dept of Spec üìú

[Andrew Morgan (anoa)](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io) says

> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals>.
>
>
> ## MSC Status
>
> **New MSCs:**
>
> * [MSC3834: Opportunistic user key pinning (TOFU)](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3834)
> * [MSC3837: Cascading profile tags for push rules](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3837)
>
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
>
> * *No MSCs are in FCP.*
>
> **Merged MSCs:**
>
> * *No MSCs were merged this week.*
>
> ## Spec Updates
>
> The big news from the spec ~~this~~ last week is the release of Matrix v1.3 üéâ (read the [blog post](https://matrix.org/blog/2022/06/16/matrix-v-1-3-release) if you haven't already)! Roughly three months since the release of Matrix v1.2, this release brings improvements such as knocking on rooms, room version 10, reduced metadata in encrypted messages and the first pieces of aggregations finally landing in the spec proper. And more! See the [blog post](https://matrix.org/blog/2022/06/16/matrix-v-1-3-release) for the full changelog.
>
> Most of the Spec Core Team has been away this week, thus there has not been much moving forwards. But we do have two new MSCs from [@duxovni](https://github.com/duxovni) and [@Johennes](https://github.com/Johennes), which you can view above.
>
> ## Random MSC of the Week
>
> The random MSC of the week is... [MSC3077: Support for multi-stream VoIP](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3077) by [@SimonBrandner](https://github.com/SimonBrandner)!
>
> This MSC allows for differentiating between different incoming streams of media coming from a single user by adding a `sdp_stream_metadata` dictionary to Voice over IP (VoIP)-related events. This is a relatively simply addition with useful functionality, such as allowing a single user to share both their camera feed and screen share at the same time!

### Populus Viewer ([website](https://github.com/opentower/populus-viewer))

A Social Annotation Tool Powered by Matrix

> Over the last few weeks we've:
>
> * improved interactions around file uploads
> * improved the look of file messages
> * reworked the login design
> * added topic configuration to room settings
> * added previews of room name and topic in tooltips for room icons
> * added handling for an eventId component of annotation URLs
>
> Along with a number of other minor bugfixes and UX improvements. And, we've added one neat new user-facing feature: inline previews of video and audio annotations. This one is a little hard to explain, but a video is worth ten thousand words:
