> Today we've released [Dendrite 0.6.1](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.6.1) which contains a number of fixes and improvements. This release includes the following changes:
> 
> * Roomserver inputs now take place with full transactional isolation in PostgreSQL deployments
> * Pull consumers are now used instead of push consumers when retrieving messages from NATS to better guarantee ordering and to reduce redelivery of duplicate messages
> * Further logging tweaks, particularly when joining rooms
> * Improved calculation of servers in the room, when checking for missing auth/prev events or state
> * Dendrite will now skip dead servers more quickly when federating by reducing the TCP dial timeout
> * The key change consumers have now been converted to use native NATS code rather than a wrapper
> * Go 1.16 is now the minimum supported version for Dendrite
> * Local clients should now be notified correctly of invites
> * The roomserver input API now has more time to process events, particularly when fetching missing events or state, which should fix a number of errors from expired contexts
> * Fixed a panic that could happen due to a closed channel in the roomserver input API
> * Logging in with uppercase usernames from old installations is now supported again (contributed by [hoernschen](https://github.com/hoernschen))
> * Federated room joins now have more time to complete and should not fail due to expired contexts
> * Events that were sent to the roomserver along with a complete state snapshot are now persisted with the correct state, even if they were rejected or soft-failed
> 
> Spec compliance, as measured by Sytest, currently sits at:
> 
> * Client-server APIs: 65%
> * Server-server APIs: 94%
> 
> As always, you can join us in [#dendrite:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org) for Dendrite discussion and announcements.

## Dept of Clients 📱

### Nheko ([website](https://nheko-reborn.github.io))

Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.

[Nico](https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev) reports

> It's FOSDEM! Don't forget to checkout my 5 min ramble about custom stickers and emotes in Matrx: https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/matrix_custom_stickers/
> 
> In preparation for FOSDEM, I've also been working on some goodies so that you can participate using Nheko in a limited manner:
> 
> * Previews for rooms are now fetched for spaces using the hierarchy API
> * Widgets for the talks should be shown below the topic as links
> 
> While this isn't grand, it should be good enough for some to participate using Nheko. You will need the latest master (some commits aren't even pushed at the time of writing!), but if you are just watching, this should give you an easy way to fetch the talk link for each room. You will still have to watch the actual talk in your browser though.
> 
> LorenDB also added a big, fat, red offline indicator. If your server dies because of FOSDEM, now Nheko will tell you.
> 
> I hope you all will have a great time and I hope I see you around!

## Dept of Non Chat Clients 🎛️

### Populus Viewer ([website](https://github.com/opentower/populus-viewer))

A Social Annotation Tool Powered by Matrix

[gleachkr](https://matrix.to/#/@gleachkr:matrix.org) says

> ### Viewer Updates
> 
> Here's a big populus viewer update! Since last time, I've been mostly working on improving the user experience and onboarding for non-experts, as well as making my teaching-assistant bot a little smarter - this work is ongoing. But I have had time for a few new features 😁
> * Populus now implements [MSC3592 - Markup locations for PDF documents](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3592), a proposal building on [MSC3574 - Marking up resources](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3574), so there's a documented format for interoperable PDF annotations (though this is not the final draft, see below!)
> * I've reworked the sidebar for the PDF view, improving the aesthetics and allowing for a "fullscreen" view of PDF content.
> * I've added user-directory search and improved the usability of the invite modal.
> 
> The reason that MSC3574 is not a final draft is that I'm increasingly looking at the w3c's [web annotation data model](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/) as a compelling foundation for annotations on Matrix. Stay tuned for a upcoming MSC, or come over to [#opentower:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#opentower:matrix.org) to talk about the future of annotation on Matrix!
> 
> ### Populus-Philarchive
> 
> I've also been working on a proof-of-concept for one Matrix use-case that I'm hoping Populus can help fill. Social annotation can be a good tool for getting feedback on works in progress, or for discussing new research with your team or lab. Wouldn't it be nice if you could just pop open a paper on a preprint archive and start commenting, or say "hey friends, I'm reading this paper, what do you think?" And wouldn't it be nicer if you could do that and host the discussion on your university or team's Matrix server?
> 
> Here's a first pass at that idea: https://opentower.github.io/populus-philarchive/
> 
> At the moment works by just pasting in paper codes from [philarchive.org](https://philarchive.org/) - it'll preview bibliographic information and give you a list of discussions taking place around a given paper, with the option to create a  new one. Sessions are shared with populus-viewer, and pdfs continue to be hosted by the original archive. There are a number of clear upgrade paths, by integrating with a preprint archive that has an open search API, or even by adding an OAI-PMH metadata harvester to the backend, to combine the metadata from a bunch of open paper archives. I'm really excited to see where this work goes.

### nehko-krunner ([website](https://github.com/LorenDB/nheko-krunner))

A KRunner plugin to list joined rooms and possibly other things from nheko.

[LorenDB](https://matrix.to/#/@lorendb:matrix.org) announces

> I have been working on a little project over the last week: [nheko-krunner](https://github.com/LorenDB/nheko-krunner). nheko-krunner is a [KRunner](https://userbase.kde.org/Plasma/Krunner) plugin that loads rooms from nheko, displays them to the user, and allows the user to activate said rooms. How does it do this? Well, I've also been creating a D-Bus API for nheko! This code has not been merged yet, but once it is, you will be able to create your own plugins that access nheko via D-Bus!
> 
> The current functionality of nheko-krunner is simply (1) search and switch to rooms that you are in (not unlike the Ctrl-K switcher), and (2) join rooms from their aliases.
> 
> If you want to try out nheko-krunner, you will need to build from the `dbus` branch in my personal fork of nheko and then install nheko-krunner from the above repo.
> 
> I hope that somebody finds this useful and I am excited to see what other D-Bus plugins may show up in the future!

You can see an example [here](https://emeraldreverie.org/example_chatstat_report.html), or check the project [wiki](https://github.com/GregSutcliffe/ChatStat/wiki/A-non-R-user's-guide-to-ChatStat) for an example of using the raw data with [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) to make custom plots of your own.

## Matrix in the News 📰

[Carl Schwan](https://matrix.to/#/@carl:kde.org) says

> The season 2 of Raising Dion (a Netflix TV show) featured shortly a video call with Riot/Element and a few other open source software (e.g. Karbon). Oh and you might recognize a few usernames in the sidebar 😅

[Moe (Moritz Dietz)](https://matrix.to/#/@moe:moritzdietz.com) announces

> Circles has made it into a small German speaking Apple News site/App called ifun.de. 
> „Circles-App: Neue alte Ideen für private soziale Netzwerke“   https://www.iphone-ticker.de/circles-app-neue-ideen-fuer-private-soziale-netzwerke-185764/
> There wasn’t a mention of Matrix - which is kind of exciting really. This means it can just be the transparent layer of great apps :)
