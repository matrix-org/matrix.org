## Dept of Spec 📜

[anoa](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz) announces

> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals>.
>
>
> ## MSC Status
>
> **New MSCs:**
>
> * [MSC3720: Account status](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3720)
> * [MSC3715: `/relations` parity with `/messages`](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3715)
> * [MSC3713: Alleviating ACL exhaustion with ACL Slots](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3713)
> * [[WIP] MSC3710: User groups](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3710)
>
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
>
> * *No MSCs are in FCP.*
>
> **MSCs with newly proposed Final Comment Period:**
>
> * [MSC3440: Threading via m.thread relation](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440)
> * [MSC3613: Combinatorial join rules](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3613)
> * [MSC3667: Enforce integer power levels](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3667)
>
> **Closed MSCs:**
>
> * [[WIP] MSC3348: Server-Server Room based extensible communication](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3348)
>
> ## Spec Updates
>
> [MSC3440](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440) (threading) continues to move forward with a proposed final comment period this week. As a really useful feature in Matrix, it's great to see it getting closer to landing in the spec.
>
> In a similar vein, [MSC3613](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3613) (combinatorial join rules) had a proposed final comment period. The intention of this is to be a simple mechanism for resolving the "it's not possible to have both a restricted and knock room" situation - as both introduced mutually exclusive join rules. This MSC will likely serve as the basis of a new room version whenever it lands.
>
> ## Random MSC of the Week
>
> The random MSC of the week is... [MSC3144: Allow Widgets By Default in Private Rooms](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3144)!
>
> This MSC makes the case for allowing widgets to be created in private rooms by default. The actual spec for it is blocked behind having widgets in the spec (see [this tracking PR](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2764) if you're interested).
>
> As noted in the PR though, this MSC could build on the existing `im.vector.modular.widgets` unstable prefix for widgets in order to create an implementation for this feature. It does not appear to have happened yet though.

## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Synapse ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/))

Synapse is the reference homeserver for Matrix

[callahad](https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org) announces

> Hello, TWIM! This week we [released Synapse 1.52](https://matrix.org/blog/2022/02/08/synapse-1-52-released), which includes new Admin APIs for monitoring federation status and immediately retrying failed connections, as well as for reporting on rooms shared between two homeservers. We've also fixed / improved media previews for sites [like Reddit](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/11767). Plus lots more fixes / refactors / improvements under the hood.
>
> This is a smaller release as it's coming off of our FOSDEM sprint, but we look forward to getting back to more regularly-sized and featureful Synapses this month.
>
> Notably, we've been experimenting with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to better manage Python dependencies in our applications (Synapse, Sygnal, and Sydent). We just [switched Sydent over](https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/pull/488) this week and are working out the kinks in our CI and build pipelines. We're looking forward to bringing this consistency to Synapse next month!
>
> See you next week!

### Dendrite ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite))

Second generation Matrix homeserver

[neilalexander](https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org) reports

> Yesterday we released [Dendrite 0.6.3](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.6.3) which is a primarily bug fix release. It contains the following changes:
>
> * Initial support for `m.login.token`
> * A number of regressions from earlier v0.6.x versions should now be corrected
> * Missing state is now correctly retrieved in cases where a gap in the timeline was closed but some of those events were missing state snapshots, which should help to unstick slow or broken rooms
> * Fixed a transaction issue where inserting events into the database could deadlock, which should stop rooms from getting stuck
> * Fixed a problem where rejected events could result in rolled back database transactions
> * Avoided a potential race condition on fetching latest events by using the room updater instead
> * Processing events from `/get_missing_events` will no longer result in potential recursion
> * Federation events are now correctly generated for updated self-signing keys and signed devices
> * Rejected events can now be un-rejected if they are reprocessed and all of the correct conditions are met
> * Fetching missing auth events will no longer error as long as all needed events for auth were satisfied
> * Users can now correctly forget rooms if they were not a member of the room
>
> As always, please feel free to join us in [#dendrite:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org) for more Dendrite-related discussions!

### Conduit ([website](https://conduit.rs))

[Timo ⚡️](https://matrix.to/#/@timokoesters:fachschaften.org) says

> Conduit v0.3.0 released last week and over 50 servers already upgraded! This week we looked into some bugs that still happen with this version:
>
> * Element Android doesn't show notifications: A bug where we send 'null' instead of leaving out a field <https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal/issues/295>
> * Missing profiles when scrolling up: Bug in multiple clients: <https://gitlab.com/famedly/conduit/-/issues/233>
>
> These bugs will be fixed in the coming days.

[J. Ryan Stinnett](https://matrix.to/#/@jryans:matrix.org) announces

> Thanks to everyone who tested the maximised widgets feature which was recently added to Element Web. It received a sudden burst of attention as part of the FOSDEM conference. 😄 This week we've been fine tuning the feature to ensure it works for more workflows, and we've also cleaned up various associated widget bugs. In particular, in the develop version of Element Web, the pin and maximise actions are more consistent accessible, so you can toggle between pinned and maximised if e.g. you're in a conference room and temporarily want the stream widget to be larger while still having access to the chat timeline.
>
> Next week we'll be focusing more on our Matrix-native collaborative document plans.

### Element iOS ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-ios))

## Dept of Non Chat Clients 🎛️

### Matrix Wrench ([website](https://gitlab.com/jaller94/matrix-wrench/))

Matrix Wrench is a web client to tweak Matrix rooms.

[ChristianP](https://matrix.to/#/@christianp:vector.modular.im) announces

> The new version contains two new features around the Synapse Admin API, making someone a room admin and listing all unencrypted media URLs.
>
> I've had some good ideas on how to make Matrix Wrench cover more use cases while staying simple for both users and me as a developer. New components allow me to add new API endpoints in as little as 7 lines. So far this only applies to simple endpoints without parameters, like joining and leaving a room, but it can be expanded to more endpoints because of how similar all Matrix endpoints are. Props to the Spec! 🙌
>
> Stay tuned for an editable UI coming soon™️.

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰

### Trixnity ([website](https://gitlab.com/benkuly/trixnity))

[gen3](https://matrix.to/#/@gen3:blackline.xyz) says

> Version 1.1.1 released
> This was a quick bugfix release for a finding by jeffcasavant, in which joining a room with a predecessor, the bot could crash. Thanks Jeff!
>
> If you missed it last week, I published a template / demo stock reporting bot you can find here: <https://github.com/WesR/Halcyon-stock-bot> . Short and sweet, this little bot should be a great starting point if your looking into making a bot. Make sure to also checkout the library itself for more examples, and usage information <https://github.com/WesR/Halcyon>.
>
> I'm always looking for more feedback, and love to see what people are working on. Come hangout with us in the Halcyon room: <https://matrix.to/#/#halcyon:blackline.xyz>

## Dept of Interesting Projects 🛰️

### Pretix Matrix Plugin

[Felix](https://matrix.to/#/@felix:fachschaften.org) says

> We have been using Matrix as a chat solution for the attendees of our biannual conference ([KIF](https://kif.rocks)) and for new students during the introduction week, as well as Pretix to register attendants. Up until now the process to invite attendees to the corresponding Matrix Rooms and Spaces involved some `curl` and `jq` magic as well as manual intervention to connect both.
>
> We have now replaced said manual process with a Pretix plugin that invites registered attendees to a configurable Matrix Room or Space. This plugin is now available on the [Pretix marketplace](https://marketplace.pretix.eu/products/pretix-matrix-inviter/) or directly from its [repository](https://gitlab.fachschaften.org/kif/pretix-matrix-inviter).

### Gatho

[Jake C](https://matrix.to/#/@jake:matrix.gatho.party) announces

> I'm excited to share a side-project I've been working on for the last ~3 months: Gatho (<http://gatho.party>) - a web app for hosting small gatherings.
>
> Gatho is perfect as a replacement for Facebook Events for small social gatherings. I'm a 24 year old Australian who recently deleted Facebook - I've used Gatho for a few parties now and the guests have loved it!
>
> Gatho includes a Matrix bot which, when added to a room, can synchronise RSVP emoji reactions to a linked Gatho event! See [gatho.party/getting-started](https://gatho.party/getting-started) to hear how the Matrix synchronization works.
>
> You can also create one-click RSVP links to send to your friends - no matter which chat/social app they use!
>
> It's fully GDPR compliant and multi-region with an EU server and database, and uses NextAuth.js for passwordless authentication.
>
> The Gatho website and bot is open source (AGPL-3.0) on [Github](https://github.com/gatho-party/gatho-website), PRs and Github issues are very welcome! It's built using Next.js in Typescript.
>
> I'd love to hear your feedback! Join the Matrix room at [#gatho-events:matrix.gatho.party](https://matrix.to/#/#gatho-events:matrix.gatho.party)
