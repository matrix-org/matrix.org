## Dept of Spec 📜

[Andrew Morgan (anoa)](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io) reports

> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals>.
>
> ## MSC Status
>
> **New MSCs:**
>
> * [MSC3892: Custom Emotes with Encryption](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3892)
> * [MSC3890: Remotely silence local notifications](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3890)
>
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
>
> * [MSC3773: Notifications for threads](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3773) (merge)
> * [MSC3715: Add a pagination direction parameter to `/relations`](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3715) (merge)
>
> **Accepted MSCs:**
>
> * _No MSCs were accepted this week._
>
> **Merged MSCs:**
>
> * _No MSCs were merged this week._
>
> ## Spec Updates
>
> This week has seen more review on threads from the Spec Core Team, as well as some further aggregations work. See the FCP list above! [MSC3771](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/issues/3771) (Read Receipts for Threads) and [MSC3856](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/issues/3856) (Threads List API) are also looking quite close to starting FCP.
>
> In other news, yours truly has written up some words (adapted from some internal docs written by @erikjohnston) amounting to [a simplified guide to writing MSCs](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/blob/anoa/spec_process_docs/README.md). The hope is that it'll help spell out the process in a more succinct manner, as well as provide answers to common questions/edge cases.
>
> The document's words are still in flux, and still only exist [as a PR](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3891); so do feel free to leave some suggestions or feedback if you have some!
>
> ## Random MSC of the Week
>
> The random MSC of the week is... [MSC3775: Markup Locations for Audiovisual Media](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3775)!
>
> I recommend looking at [MSC3574](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3574) (marking up resources) first as MSC3775 builds upon it. But as for MSC3775 itself, the MSC adds support for annotating media - storing those annotations as events in a Matrix room!
>
> This could be useful for building a decentralised app for marking up audio files. Collaborative audio editing anyone?
>
> As far as I can tell, this MSC is currently waiting for [MSC3574](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3574) to progress before it itself moves much further. But feel free to check out both in the meantime if you're interested.

## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Synapse ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/))

Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team

[Brendan Abolivier](https://matrix.to/#/@babolivier:element.io) announces

> This week we've released [Synapse 1.67](https://matrix.org/blog/2022/09/14/synapse-1-67-released/)! This Synapse release is the first one to use [Poetry 1.2](https://python-poetry.org/blog/announcing-poetry-1.2.0/), and also removes the long-deprecated TCP-based replication protocol. Synapse workers are now required to use the Redis-based protocol which we introduced back in 2020. If this isn't already the case for your deployment of Synapse, see the [documentation for workers](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.67/workers.html#shared-configuration) as well as the [upgrade notes](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.67/upgrade.html#direct-tcp-replication-is-no-longer-supported-migrate-to-redis), to update your configuration.
>
> In other news, Synapse 1.68 (which is due to release on the 27th of September) will introduce a couple of changes in dependencies. The minimum supported SQLite version will be raised to 3.26, meaning that Synapse 1.67 is the last version of Synapse supporting SQLite versions 3.22 to 3.26. In addition to this, a Rust compiler will be required for source checkouts, as we are starting to introduce Rust code in Synapse (as I [mentioned last week](https://matrix.org/blog/2022/09/09/this-week-in-matrix-2022-09-09#synapse-website)). This latter change should not impact installations that use `pip install matrix-synapse`, Debian packages from `packages.matrix.org` or the `matrixdotorg/synapse` Docker image to manage and run Synapse. See the [upgrade notes](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.67/upgrade.html#rust-requirement-in-the-next-release) for more information about these two changes.

## Homeserver Deployment 📥️

## Dept of Bridges 🌉

### Postmoogle ([website](https://gitlab.com/etke.cc/postmoogle))

An Email to Matrix bridge. 1 room = 1 mailbox.

[Aine](https://matrix.to/#/@aine:etke.cc) announces

> Postmoogle v0.9.2
>
> * bugfixes
> * speed up email delivery
> * StartTLS enabled automatically if TLS cert and key are provided
> * set `msgtype` by attachment's mime-type (received image -> got rendered image in your matrix client; received audio -> got audio player in your matrix client; etc)
>
> [Source code](https://gitlab.com/etke.cc/postmoogle), say hi in the [#postmoogle:etke.cc](https://matrix.to/#/#postmoogle:etke.cc) room
### matrix-hookshot ([website](https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-hookshot))

A multi purpose multi platform bridge, formerly known as matrix-github

[Half-Shot](https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk) says

> ### matrix-hookshot 2.2.0 arrives with fewer bugs and more features!
>
> Hello gang. This week, another hookshot release. They do come fast!
>
> We've fixed a bug which had the potential to cause crashes when JSON logging is enabled, and written a whole torture test for the logger to ensure it won't do that again. We've also made some quality of life improvements to the GitLab connection type :)
>
> The highlights are:
>
> * Ready/draft state changes for GitLab merge requests are now reported. ([#480](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/480))
> * Merge GitLab MR approvals and comments into one message. ([#484](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/484))
>
> You can get the latest release [here](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/releases/tag/2.2.0)
>
> ---
>
> But I have a bit more for you this week, we're working on a few new features to hopefully improve the lives of developers out there building webhook integrations.
>
> First, we are adding the ability to **view requests and logging** from within the widget UI. This means you can now debug why your webhooks might not be working without
> having to leave your client. This includes the ability to log debug messages and read them back later!
>
>
> {{ youtube_player(video_id="DStAgLhmZqs") }}
>
>
> Secondly, we're adding some new sci-fi functions to the scripting environment. The first of which will allow you to **embed images / videos** into the message output, with a
> function to to create matrix content URLs from a regular URL.
>
> Finally, and this is probably the most sci-fi. We're working on a feature for you to **load scripts from other rooms** for use in your webhook. This means developers will be able to build
> whole webhook handling libraries within rooms, and then share those libraries across the federation. At the moment, this looks a bit like:
>
> ```js
> const resultOfScript = await loadMatrixScript("matrix:r/my-room-alias:domain/$my-event-id");
> // ... mutate the result
> return = resultOfScript
> ```
>
> We're still thinking about how to ensure it's both performant, and safe but the initial results are looking quite good.
>
> That's all we have for you in bridging corner today, have a good weekend 👋

### matrix-appservice-kakaotalk ([website](https://src.miscworks.net/fair/matrix-appservice-kakaotalk/))

A Matrix-KakaoTalk puppeting bridge.

[Fair](https://matrix.to/#/@fair:miscworks.net) announces

> It has been brought to my attention that the KakaoTalk service has been updated to block older clients, and unfortunately this bridge is affected.  As of this writing, **using the bridge may get your KakaoTalk account banned!**  It has happened to both me and at least one other person, so this isn't just a hypothetical risk.
>
> To be clear about this, I've updated the `master` branch to throw an error on startup, which must be manually removed from source code if you wish to continue using the bridge at your own risk.
>
> It's currently unknown what it takes to log in safely, but discussion about it is ongoing (albeit intermittently) in the discussion channel (linked below).
>
> Once the bridge is safe to use again, I'll post a TWIM update about it 🙂
>
> ---
>
> * Discussion: [#matrix-appservice-kakaotalk:miscworks.net](https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-appservice-kakaotalk:miscworks.net)
> * Testing room: [#kakaotalk-bridge-testing:miscworks.net](https://matrix.to/#/#kakaotalk-bridge-testing:miscworks.net) / <https://open.kakao.com/o/gjGQFuae>

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰

### matrix-rust-sdk ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk))

Next-gen crypto-included SDK for developing Clients, Bots and Appservices; written in Rust with bindings for Node, Swift and WASM

[ben](https://matrix.to/#/@gnunicorn:matrix.org) reports

> Major Milestone: yesterday [Sliding Sync was merged into `main`](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/728), now available behind the `sliding-sync`-feature flag and enabled by default for `matrix-sdk-ffi` for your convenience. This, too, means the `jack-in` sliding sync-test client is merged and part of our `labs` section - go out and have a try! Furthermore the [key verification for crypto-js](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/788) has been merged, as well as [support for logging out](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1013), including tracking the soft-logout state in FFI, and support for sending [`markdown` from FFI](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1038),
>
> Similarly the new [Timeline API](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/940), is making big leaps forward, we expecting it to land, too. It will also be available behind a feature-flag replacing the previous `experimental-timeline`-feature. If you were using that, please pay close attention to what is going on, as it will replace most of if not all of the previous API and data store.
>
> Both will be available, also together, in the upcoming release 0.6 of matrix-sdk, which we expect to land before the end of the month. It was slightly pushed back as the [`sync event` changes turned out to be more of a rabbit hole](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1022) than anticipated.

### matrix-docker-ansible-deploy ([website](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy))

Matrix server setup using Ansible and Docker

[Slavi](https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com) announces

> [matrix-docker-ansible-deploy](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy) now has much-improved Synapse worker support:
>
> * we've added support for [Stream writer](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/workers.html#stream-writers) workers
> * we've added support for running multiple federation sender workers (until now, we only supported 1 at most)
> * we've added support for running multiple pusher workers (until now, we only supported 1 at most)
> * we've added support for running [background tasks on a worker](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/workers.html#background-tasks)
> * we've restored support for `appservice` workers (we had removed support for these after Synapse v1.59.0 deprecated them and redid how this type of worker is meant to be spawned)
> * we've restored support for `user_dir` workers (we had removed support for these after Synapse v1.59.0 deprecated them and redid how this type of worker is meant to be spawned)
> * we've made it possible to reliably use more than 1 `media_repository` worker (until now, using more than 1 could have caused issues due to us not correctly restricting where media background tasks run)
>
> Some backward incompatible changes were made, which could affect some people.
>
> People who are using some reocmmendation configuration like `matrix_synapse_workers_preset: one-of-each` will now get 9 additional worker processes by default.
>
> To learn more, see [our changelog entry](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#potential-backward-compatibility-break-major-improvements-to-synapse-workers)
