> ## Spec Updates
>
> I hope you like new MSCs, because this week has had a lot of them!
>
> Spec Core Team review this week has focused on getting the remaining bits of threads over the line, mainly [MSC3773](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3773), [MSC3771](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3771), [MSC3874](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3874) and [MSC3856](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3856).
>
> ## Random MSC of the Week
>
> The random MSC of the week is... [MSC2730: Verifiable forwarded events](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2730)!
>
> Ever noticed how when you forward an event in Matrix today, it simply looks like you've just copy/pasted the message and sent it yourself? Other messengers will often include some metadata with the forwarded message to inform the room that it's a message originally from another room and/or user, rather than being originally authored by yourself.
>
> This MSC attempts to optionally add that metadata to messages, with the crucial goal of preventing that metadata from being faked (which could be dangerous). Check if out if that's something that interests you!

## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Synapse ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/))

Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team

[Brendan Abolivier](https://matrix.to/#/@babolivier:element.io) reports

> This week the team released [Synapse 1.67.0rc1](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.67.0rc1)! This first release candidate includes a few features, a bunch of notable performance improvements and bugfixes, and also removes the long-deprecated TCP replication. We thank everyone who help us test this RC by running it ahead of the release next week, and reporting any bug or feedback on [the Synapse repo](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=BUG_REPORT.yml) or in [#synapse:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#synapse:matrix.org), respectively.
>
> Another very exciting thing that happened this week is the merge of the base code infrastructure to support running Rust code in Synapse! You can find more about this in [the pull request](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/12595), but what this means is we can now replace some bits of Synapse written in Python with code written in Rust to make it more efficient. This is _not_ a rewrite of Synapse in Rust, but rather a way for us to optimise some specific hot paths. Currently there's some more work going on with [implementing push rules support in Rust](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/13720), as well as [converting some caching code](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/13733). Watch this space for more info!

### Dendrite ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite))

Second generation Matrix homeserver

[neilalexander](https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org) announces

> This week we released [Dendrite 0.9.7](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.9.7) with quite a few bug fixes and performance improvements. It's a recommended upgrade, so if you have a Dendrite installation, please upgrade! Changes include:
>
> * Initial supporting code to enable full-text search has been merged (although not ready for use yet)
> * Newly created rooms now have higher default power levels for enabling encryption, setting server ACLs or sending tombstone events
> * Incoming signing key updates over federation are now queued in JetStream for processing, so that they cannot be dropped accidentally
> * A race condition between the roomserver output events being generated, forward extremities being updated and room info being updated has been fixed
> * Appservices will no longer receive invite events which they are not interested in, which caused heavy load in some cases or excessive request sizes in others
> * A bug in state resolution v2 where events could incorrectly be classified as control events has been fixed
> * A bug in state resolution v2 where some specific events with unexpected non-empty state keys are dropped has been fixed
> * A bug in state resolution v2 when fetching auth events vs partial state has been fixed
> * Stale device lists should now be handled correctly for all user IDs, which may help with E2EE reliability
> * A number of database writer issues have been fixed in the user API and sync API, which should help to reduce `database is locked` errors with SQLite databases
> * Database migrations should now be detected more reliably to prevent unexpected errors at startup
> * A number of minor database transaction issues have been fixed, particularly for assigning NIDs in the roomserver, cleaning up device keys and cleaning up notifications
> * The database query for finding shared users in the sync API has been optimised, using significantly less CPU time as a result
>
> As always, please feel free to join us in [#dendrite:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org) for more Dendrite-related discussion.

[kittykat](https://matrix.to/#/@kittykat:matrix.org) says

> * 🔒 We had a security release: please update to v1.11.4 ASAP.
> * The DM flow has seen a rework: when you start a DM with someone for the first time, they will only see the room after you send your first message (in any form) rather than when you first open the room
>
> In labs (you can enable labs features in settings on develop.element.io or on Nightly):

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰

### Trixnity ([website](https://gitlab.com/trixnity/trixnity))

Multiplatform Kotlin SDK for Matrix

[Benedict](https://matrix.to/#/@benedict:imbitbu.de) says

> I externalized the building of libolm binaries into a [separate git repository](https://gitlab.com/trixnity/olm-binaries). As a result, opening the Trixnity project does not need any C-Library-Building-Tools, because the binaries are just downloaded. On the one hand this speeds up building Trixnity significantly and on the other hand contributing to Trixnity is much easier (especially on Windows machines). Just do `./gradlew build`.

### matrix-rust-sdk ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk))

Next-gen crypto-included SDK for developing Clients, Bots and Appservices; written in Rust with bindings for Node, Swift and WASM

[ben](https://matrix.to/#/@gnunicorn:matrix.org) reports

> This week saw the merge of [PR/Issue #1000](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1000), a milestone, that, though random, marks the continuous progress and pace this project has taken up. 🥂 to the next 1000!
>
> Further more we saw the merge of [make `create_dm_room` public](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1015), allowing any developer using the SDK to use it as well saw the first review of the [sliding sync PR](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/728), which now also has [a tracking issue](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues/1014) explaining what remains to be done (and when) once the PR has landed. Other than that we had several refactorings, clean ups and minor fixes merged, in anticipation of the upcoming release of 0.6, which we expect to land before the end of the month. If all goes will that release will contain both sliding sync and [the new timeline API](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/940) behind feature flags to use and play with. 🫰 Fingers crossed.

>
> In this release we've updated matrix-js-sdk to the latest version 19.4.0, which was a big jump. This opens up the path to adding support for End-to-end Encryption and Sliding Sync - and are looking for people excited to work on this.
>
> I've also rolled it out to the [preview version of TypeCell](https://www.typecell.org); which is a multiplayer document / programming environment that runs on top of Matrix (more soon!)
