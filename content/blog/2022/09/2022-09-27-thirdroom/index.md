We're excited to announce the first tech preview of [Third Room](https://thirdroom.io/), an open, standards-based, decentralised vision of the metaverse for the open Web, built entirely on Matrixâ€¦ without cryptocurrencies, NFTs or walled gardens.

To see what it's all about, head over to <https://thirdroom.io/preview> - or come chat in [#thirdroom-dev:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#thirdroom-dev:matrix.org) to learn more!
