Happy TWIMday everyone! Thib is away this week again, so I'm covering for him as your host in this edition of This Week In Matrix.

## Matrix Live 🎙

{{ youtube_player(video_id="eUBH_pucv4g") }}

Following up on [last week's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCsw1bbBjAM) about using Docker Compose to install Synapse, this week Thib explains how to use Ansible to deploy your own Matrix homeserver.

## Dept of *Status of Matrix* 🌡️

[TravisR](https://matrix.to/#/@travis:t2l.io) reports

> Earlier in the year, [t2bot.io passed 1 Million known rooms](https://matrix.org/blog/2022/03/04/this-week-in-matrix-2022-03-04#dept-of-status-of-matrix-%EF%B8%8F) and now it's passed 10 Million bridged users (10,039,915 users to be exact, at time of writing). Most of these users will be people who have participated in a channel/chat on Discord or Telegram that was bridged to Matrix through t2bot.io's free service, with about 500 thousand being active each month.
>
> Approximately 8 Million of the users are from Telegram, covering about 11% of all Telegram users (previously 15% based on information available at the time). The remaining 2 Million are Discord users, roughly 0.5% of Discord's user base. For perspective, t2bot.io has just over 683 Million events in the database and is bridging between 30 and 40 thousand people a day.
>
> Like last time, this is just a milestone update, though it's also a good reminder to host your own server if you can. Element's own [hosting platform](https://element.io/matrix-services) is a great option if you'd like to have a server without running it yourself, and [Beeper](https://www.beeper.com/) offers a richer bridging experience than t2bot.io can feasibly provide. If you'd like to go down the self-hosting route, check out Thib's video guide on hosting synapse or [last week's Matrix Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCsw1bbBjAM) for a better understanding of what hosting Synapse actually means.
>
> As for an interesting statistic: despite not having much functionality that deals with Spaces, t2bot.io can see 2687 Spaces from the wider world. The plan in the coming months is to support a way to bridge a whole Discord server to a Matrix Space, making this statistic hopefully more interesting as time goes on.

## Dept of Spec 📜

[uhoreg](https://matrix.to/#/@hubert:uhoreg.ca) reports

> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals.
>
>
> ## MSC Status
>
> **Merged MSCs:**
> * *No MSCs were merged this week.*
>
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
> * *No MSCs are in FCP.*
>
> **New MSCs:**
> * [MSC3874: Filtering threads from the /messages endpoint](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3874)
> * [MSC3873: event_match dotted keys](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3873)
> * [MSC3872: Order of rooms in Spaces](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3872)
>
> ## Spec Core Team
>
> The Spec Core Team has been continuing to push forward on the spec.  Several new MSCs have been opened recently.  The Spec Core Team is available in [#sct-office:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org) when  MSC authors think that they are ready for primetime.
>
> ## Random MSC of the Week
>
> The random MSC of the week is... [MSC2162: Signaling Errors at Bridges](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2162)!
>
> Bridges sometimes are unable to relay messages to the remote service for one reason or another.  This MSC proposes a way to allow bridges to indicate that a message failed to be delivered, and allow users to tell the bridge to retry.

## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Synapse ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/))

Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team

[Brendan Abolivier](https://matrix.to/#/@babolivier:element.io) says

> This week we've released [Synapse 1.66.0rc1](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.66.0rc1)! This upcoming release deprecates delegating email validation to an identity server (more info [here](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.66/upgrade.html#upgrading-to-v1660)) and includes improved validation around user-interactive authentication, support for a couple of experimental features, as well as the usual batch of bug fixes and performance improvements 🙂
>
> As always, any help with testing and feedback on this RC is appreciated! Feel free to drop any feedback or bug report in [#synapse:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#synapse:matrix.org) and [the Synapse repo](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=BUG_REPORT.yml) respectively.

### Dendrite ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite))

Second generation Matrix homeserver

[neilalexander](https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org) announces

> This week we released [Dendrite 0.9.5](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.9.5) which includes a number of fixes, particularly for federation:
>
> * The roomserver will now correctly unreject previously rejected events if necessary when reprocessing
> * The handling of event soft-failure has been improved on the roomserver input by no longer applying rejection rules and still calculating state before the event if possible
> * The federation `/state` and `/state_ids` endpoints should now return the correct error code when the state isn't known instead of returning a HTTP 500
> * The federation `/event` should now return outlier events correctly instead of returning a HTTP 500
> * A bug in the federation backoff allowing zero intervals has been corrected
> * The `create-account` utility will no longer error if the homeserver URL ends in a trailing slash
> * A regression in `/sync` introduced in 0.9.4 should be fixed
>
> As always, please feel free to join us in [#dendrite:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org) for more Dendrite-related discussion.

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰

### simplematrixbotlib ([website](https://github.com/KrazyKirby99999/simple-matrix-bot-lib))

simplematrixbotlib is an easy to use bot library for the Matrix ecosystem written in Python and based on matrix-nio.

[HarHarLinks](https://matrix.to/#/@kim:sosnowkadub.de) says

> [simplematrixbotlib](https://github.com/i10b/simplematrixbotlib) has reached version [2.7.0](https://github.com/i10b/simplematrixbotlib/releases/tag/v2.7.0), adding support for end-to-end encryption! 🎉
> Come chat over at [#simplematrixbotlib:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#simplematrixbotlib:matrix.org)!
>
> Here is a summary of things that have happened since we last announced v2.6.3 on this channel:
> * 🌐 The repo canonically moved to https://github.com/i10b/simplematrixbotlib, but the PyPI package remains available in the usual place.
> * 🔒️ E2EE support! To enable it, simply install the optional e2ee dependencies. Find out how in [the manual](https://simple-matrix-bot-lib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual.html#e2e-encryption).
> * 😄 Emoji verification support! Enable the option and you'll be able to interactively verify between the bot and your devices. (But mind that for now, [in-room verification is not supported, but only to-device](https://simple-matrix-bot-lib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual.html#interactive-sas-verification-using-emoji)).
> * ☝️ Fingerprint verification support! As an additional method, the bot will print it's encryption fingerprint so you can "manually verify".
> * 🗄️ Extensible config file! It is now easier than ever to add your own configuration options to the built-in TOML config file.
> * 🧹 The usual housekeeping, bumping matrix-nio to 0.19.0.
> * 🗨️ I ([HarHarLinks](https://github.com/HarHarLinks)) will be presenting the library this weekend at [#matrix-summit-berlin-2022:c-base.org](https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-summit-berlin-2022:c-base.org)! If you are in the Berlin 🇩🇪 area, come visit c-base!
