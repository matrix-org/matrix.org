Hey all,

We’ve just released [Matrix 1.5](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5), a largely maintenance update for the spec. We intentionally haven’t landed any major features in this release as Matrix 1.4, [just shy of 2 months ago](https://matrix.org/blog/2022/09/29/matrix-v-1-4-release), had introduced fairly large features for clients and servers to consider. As with all spec releases, we encourage implementations to gradually update over the next few months rather than expect them to have support for everything on release day.

Matrix 1.5 sees just 2 MSCs get merged, though this is to be expected from a maintenance release. We expect that the next release (in Q1 2023) will have a few more exciting features to it :)

We’ve covered both MSCs below, but read on to the full changelog for the full picture.


## MSC3267: Reference relations

Already supported implicitly by the spec up until now, [reference relations](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#reference-relations) are a way to simply reference another event. Usually these sorts of relations are used for events which need to be related to each other, but a dedicated relationship type doesn’t make a lot of sense.

[In-room verification](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#key-verification-framework) and [MSC3381: Polls](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3381) are examples of how these relations get used.


## MSC3905: Clarify appservice interest in user IDs

[MSC3905](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3905) fixes an issue in the specification where appservices (usually bridges) specifying a users regex without homeserver domain would end up receiving far more event traffic than they would have intended. With the MSC, appservices are now only considered interested in “local” users, regardless of how vague their users namespace is.

Overall this should have no effect on most bridges/appservices, however if an appservice in the wild really does need to listen to all users on all homeservers, it can specify a non-exclusive namespace on all rooms instead.

While writing this MSC into the spec we took some time to clarify the appservice registration requirements more generally: check them out [here](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/application-service-api/#registration).


## The full changelog

MSCs are how the spec changes in the way it does - adding, fixing, and maintaining features for the whole ecosystem to use. Check out the full changelog below, and the [Spec Change Proposals](https://spec.matrix.org/proposals/) page for more information on how these MSCs got merged (hint: they submitted a proposal, which anyone can do - take a look at the [Matrix Live episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFkZz60RRfc) where Matthew covers the proposal process).
