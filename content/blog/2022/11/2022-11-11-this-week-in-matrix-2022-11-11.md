## Dept of *Status of Matrix* 🌡️

[andybalaam](https://matrix.to/#/@andybalaam:matrix.org) reports

> A few Matrix folks went to IETF115 this week, and here is my Trip Report: [Can Matrix help messaging standardisation through MIMI?](https://www.artificialworlds.net/blog/2022/11/09/ietf115-trip-report-can-matrix-help-messaging-standardisation-through-mimi/)

## Dept of Spec 📜

[Andrew Morgan (anoa)](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io) announces

> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals.
> 
> ## MSC Status
> 
> **New MSCs:**
> * [MSC3926: Disable server-default notifications for bot users by default](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3926)
> 
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
> * *No MSCs are in FCP.*
> 
> **Accepted MSCs:**
> * [MSC3030: Jump to date API endpoint](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3030)
> 
> ## Spec updates
> 
> This week the Spec Core Team has been working with the IETF More Instant Messaging Interoperability (MIMI) working group to define a charter. With a charter, the working group is able to start thinking about implementation and design details, which means talking even more about Matrix!
> 
> We had the opportunity to discuss Matrix with several interested people at IETF this week, and are extremely excited for the (long) road ahead: even in the event where Matrix doesn't get accepted, we hope the protocol(s) the working group publishes will be fit for purpose and adopted widely (not to mention our own spec will be better as a result). 
> 
> To find out more about what we're doing in this space or to learn more, check out this week's Matrix Live above!
> 
> ## Random MSC of the Week
> 
> The random MSC of the week is... [MSC3381: Polls (mk II)](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3381)!
> 
> Polls! They are useful for quickly gauging whether a group of people agree, or entirely disagree on a topic or choice. This is an MSC with a fairly long history, but has received experimental implementation in a small number of Matrix clients. The concept uses Extensible Events, and there are plans to rewrite it off the back of changes in [MSC1767](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1767) (extensible events). But for now, it works and is a fun feature.
> 
> It's likely worth waiting for the rewrite before commenting on the MSC with detailed changes, but otherwise feel free to have a read to see how it currently works!

## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Feta ([website](https://www.feta.bz/))

[geoffledak](https://matrix.to/#/@geoffledak:matrix.org) announces

> ## Feta is a Matrix server distribution for the Raspberry Pi 3 and 4.
> 
> It is a an operating system image, based on Raspberry Pi OS Lite and includes the Matrix Synapse server, a self-hosted Element client, Postgres database, and it generates an SSL certificate for your domain using Certbot. The coturn TURN server is also included so voice and video calls work without any additional configuration.
> 
> 
> ## The provided setup script will have your server up and running in a matter of minutes.
> 
> All you need to do is configure your DNS settings for your domain, forward some ports through your router, and boot up your Raspberry Pi. Once setup is complete, enjoy your new Matrix server! Synapse, Element, Postgres, coturn, and federation are all preconfigured for you.
> 
> Visit https://www.feta.bz/ to download and get more info.

Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team

[squah](https://matrix.to/#/@squah:matrix.org) says

> Synapse 1.71.0 has been released! It contains the usual round of bugfixes and performance improvements, plus some new features. Notably, Synapse now supports:
> 
> * back-channel logouts from OpenID Connect providers.
> * Postgres and SQLite full-text search operators in search queries.
> * MSC3664, push rules for relations.
> 
> Server administrators should be aware that:
> 
> * legacy Prometheus metric names are now disabled by default, and will be removed altogether in Synapse 1.73.0.
>   If not already done, server administrators should update their dashboards and alerting rules to avoid using the deprecated metric names.
> * Synapse 1.71.0 will be the last release to support PostgreSQL 10. Server administrators are encouraged to upgrade their PostgreSQL servers before the next release, if needed.
> 
> You can read more about v1.71.0 here: https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases
> 
> In the mean time, the team has been working on the remaining parts of faster room joins.

## Dept of Bridges 🌉

### Postmoogle ([website](https://gitlab.com/etke.cc/postmoogle))

An Email to Matrix bridge. 1 room = 1 mailbox.

[Aine](https://matrix.to/#/@aine:etke.cc) announces

> 
> Yep, no pinned release yet, but there are some exciting features in the `main` branch (`latest` docker image):
> 
> **multi-domain support!**
> 
> You can have one main email domain (eg: [the-etke.cc](https://etke.cc/)) and multiple additional domains that will be used as aliases ([not-etke.cc](https://etke.cc/), [example.com](https://example.com/)), so you can get more spam to the [user@the-etke.cc](https://example.com/), [user@not-etke.cc](https://example.com/) and [user@example.com](https://example.com/) at the same time!
> 
> **bridged thread replies!**
> 
> the last planned feature of the roadmap: send reply (reply-to or thread reply) to an email message in the matrix room and it will automatically set all magic stuff (`In-Reply-To` header, subject with `Re: %original message's subject%`, etc) and send email. It's pretty rough implementation, so feedback is appreciated!

### Ruma ([website](https://www.ruma.io))

A set of Rust library crates for working with the Matrix protocol. Ruma’s approach to Matrix emphasizes correctness, security, stability and performance.

[Jonas Platte](https://matrix.to/#/@jplatte:flipdot.org) announces

> Since our last update in June (yeah, sorry...), we released Ruma 0.7.0 and a few patch releases including all of the following and more:
> 
> * Support for refresh tokens (MSC2918 / Matrix 1.4)
> * Unstable support for discovering an OpenID Connect Server (MSC2965)
> * Unstable support for private read receipts
> * Lots of API refinements, like renaming `AnyRoomEvent` to `AnyTimelineEvent`
> * Support for Room Version 10
> * Unstable support for sliding sync
> 
> Since this release was released back in September, a bunch of things have also happened that are not released yet:
> 
> * Many features were moved out of unstable feature flags because they were stabilized in Matrix 1.4
> * We made message construction easier than ever with improvements to markdown detection and improvements to reply and edit creation
> * We refactored and extended the push notification code
> * We are about to conclude a massive refactoring that should make our codebase look less strange if you are familiar with Rust, and could help compile times as well

### matrix-rust-sdk ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk))

Next-gen crypto-included SDK for developing Clients, Bots and Appservices; written in Rust with bindings for Node, Swift and WASM

[ben](https://matrix.to/#/@gnunicorn:matrix.org) announces

> This week has seen important strives forward on [sliding sync, which now has a PR up for offline support](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1193) and the new timeline API, with some [initial unittests](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1192) and [video messages](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1196) support merged and [support for file messages coming up](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1203). On the FFI, we now have support for [logging in Android](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1199) and work on [moving the iOS binding scripts into our internal xtask cli](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1201).
> 
> As usual a lot of work is been going in the background without any visible, tangible outcome yet. On one side we are making great progress on getting a first async-prototype for uniffi with python working, on the other we have been profiling the sdk on iOS mobile devices for its memory footprint - which is a major blocker for notification support.
