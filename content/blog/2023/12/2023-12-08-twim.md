> ```dart
> final client = Client('Client Name',
>   databaseBuilder: (client) => MatrixSdkDatabase(
>     'Database Name',
>     database: await databaseFactory.openDatabase(':memory:'),
>   ),
>   legacyDatabaseBuilder: yourPreviousDatabase,
> );
> ```
> 
> As for the work currently being done:
> 
> * matrixRTC changes (extending msc3041 :3)

## Dept of Events and Talks 🗣️

### Matrix Messaging Community at 37C3

[erebion 🏳️‍🌈♾](https://matrix.to/#/@erebion:erebion.eu) says

> The [37th Chaos Communication Congress](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2023/infos/index.html), sort of a school reunion of hackers, is coming up.
> 
> From the 27th to the 30th of December 2023, a bunch of cool and nerdy people will meet up in Hamburg (northern Germany) to discuss all the cool stuff they have been up to. Topics will have a range as wide as technology, society, politics and even food hacking as well as a whole lot of other interesting things.
> 
> Tickets will be required, but are only available in very limited supply. If you are lucky, you might just be able to still buy one at <https://tickets.events.ccc.de/>.
> 
> We [previously](https://matrix.org/blog/2023/11/17/this-week-in-matrix-2023-11-17/) announced that we would be trying to set up an assembly.
> 
> An assembly is basically a place where people interested in a topic can assemble (hence the name). Just like at the Chaos Communication Camp, there will be a place where you can meet up with other people interested in Matrix, exchange your thoughts and ideas or ask questions. There will also be workshops and you should be able to find someone that will gladly help you with setting up your Matrix homeserver.
> 
> Talk with us if you would like to hold a workshop or give a presentation. But also come and visit us if you just want to hang out with like-minded people or tell us about how you are running a Matrix client on a graphic calculator or whatever other cool stuff you might be up to. You will be able to shape this assembly and make it something cool.
> 
> Further info can be found on the [Matrix Community Assembly's page](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2023/hub/de/assembly/matrix)
> 
> You can also already join [#chaosevents:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#chaosevents:matrix.org) and say hello there. We are looking forward to seeing you!
