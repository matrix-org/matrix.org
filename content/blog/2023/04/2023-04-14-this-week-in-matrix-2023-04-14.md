> ## Spec Updates
>
> The concept of Linearized Matrix ([MSC3995](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3995)) is moving forwards as a potential answer to the European Union's, Digital Markets Act. The fully-decentralised Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG) model of Matrix is well-known, yet complex to implement and thus a potential blocker to gatekeepers who are looking for an interoperable messaging protocol to link their chat service to. Enter Linearized Matrix, a concept of a Matrix room that uses a linked-list to store events in a room, rather than a DAG. Crucially, while being simpler to implement, our aim is to be forward-compatible with the DAG version of Matrix, such that gatekeepers may switch over to DAG-style Matrix in the future if they so chose.
>
> See [MSC3995](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3995) for more information, and a reminder that this is all still very much in flux!
>
> ## Random MSC of the Week
>
> The random MSC of the week is... [MSC2943: Return an event ID for membership endpoints](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2943)!
>
> Currently, when you send a (state) event manually via [PUT /\_matrix/client/v3/rooms/{roomId}/send/{eventType}/{txnId}](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/client-server-api/#put_matrixclientv3roomsroomidsendeventtypetxnid), you'll receive an event ID in the response. While you can send membership events this way, it's often a bit nicer to use the various `POST /_matrix/client/v3/rooms/{roomId}/join,leave,kick` endpoints instead. However, these do not return an event ID in their response. For clients that don't use [`/sync`](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv3sync), this would force them to use the former, generic endpoint in order to retrieve the event ID of the membership event.
>
> [MSC2943](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2943) attempts to rectify that by specifying that membership-related endpoints should return an event ID, similar to the generic event send endpoint. Currently this MSC is just waiting on an implementation in a homeserver (and possible a client) in order to move forward. If you feel strongly about this change being included in the Matrix spec, why not get your hands dirty with some homeserver dev?

## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Synapse ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/))

Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team

[Shay](https://matrix.to/#/@shayshay:matrix.org) reports

> Another week has gone by and we here at Synapse have another release for you, v1.81.0, filled with features and bugfixes. But first some announcements:
>
> Synapse now attempts the versioned appservice paths before falling back to the [legacy paths](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/application-service-api/#legacy-routes). Usage of the legacy routes should be considered deprecated.
>
> Additionally, Synapse has supported sending the application service access token via [the `Authorization` header](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/application-service-api/#authorization) since v1.70.0. For backwards compatibility it is _also_ sent as the `access_token` query parameter. This is insecure and should be considered deprecated.
>
> A future version of Synapse (v1.88.0 or later) will remove support for legacy application service routes and query parameter authorization.
>
> And now the highlights:
>
> * Added the ability to enable/disable registrations when in the OIDC flow.
> * Added a primitive helper script for listing worker endpoints.
> * Built Debian packages for Ubuntu 23.04 (Lunar Lobster)
> * Fixed a long-standing bug preventing users from rejoining rooms after being banned and unbanned over federation. Contributed by Nico.
> * Fixed a long-standing bug where edits of non-`m.room.message` events would not be correctly bundled.
> * Fixed a bug introduced in Synapse v1.55.0 which could delay remote homeservers being able to decrypt encrypted messages sent by local users.
>
> And so much more! To read about everything in the release, take a look at the release notes [here](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.81.0) and otherwise have a great week.

### Construct ([website](https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct))

A performance-oriented homeserver with minimal dependencies.

[Jason Volk](https://matrix.to/#/@jevolk:matrix.org) reports

> You probably know about the client command-line that pops up when a message starts with `/`. Construct has its own server-side command-line when a message starts with `\`. Unlike commands sent to the `!control` room, the server-side command-line is available to all users and not just administrators. In fact, the `!control` room is quite passé as I find myself always using the `control` server-side command, since the results can be echoed to the room I'm in and others can see it too.
>
> This week Construct's server-side command-line gained the `watch` command. This is similar to `watch(1)` in unix environments. You type `watch <interval> <command>` to repeat your command at a set interval. Previously the `watch` command was only available at the terminal [console](https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct/wiki/Useful-console-command-examples#accessing-the-console). The `watch` command will run until you click the ▶️ button, or redact the command itself.

## Dept of Clients 📱

### Nheko ([website](https://nheko-reborn.github.io))

Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.

[Nico](https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev) reports

> Since I found some time to step away from the 3d printer (damn, those things are addiciting), let me give you an update of some of the changes happening recently in Nheko!
>
> A very fundamental change from LorenDB is that Nheko now renders messages it doesn't understand. For various reasons Nheko always tried to hide those from you, but LorenDB convinced me, that showing them has more benefits than downsides and also did all the changes and wrote plenty of tests, even when I was especially picky! And at the same time Nheko can now render the rainfall chat effect. 🌧️
>
> Similarly I reworked how our message variant/enum type works. This made the debug build of Nheko shrink from 450MB to 350MB for me, which is quite significant, even if it probably has no visible impact on any users, since the compressed debug size as well as the stripped binary are basically the same size. (The flatpaks were at 5MB download size and still are at 5MB download size.) It does make some of our error messages nicer and allows us to implement some further improvements for devs down the line. It does mean Nheko now won't compile on GCC10 anymore though, which is included in the current debian stable release. But the next Debian release is just around the corner, so hopefully the impact from that is limited.
>
> We also had a nice contribution from Sateallia: You can now order rooms alphabetically. While I never saw any use for that feature, some people can't live without it and I appreciate that someone stepped up to implement it.
>
> And the last interesting change, we teaked our threads UI a bit again. Because it was easy to miss, that a message is in a thread, we added a thread indicator on the left as well. We are still experimenting if that should replace the old indicator or it should complement it, so lease give feedback if it is an improvement or not.

> * Url previews can now be configured from the settings
> * Read markers for other users will now be shown
> * The menu has been replaced by buttons in various more natural place
> * Various keybindings and shortcuts have been implemented and improved
> * The notification count in the system tray is working once again
> * Messages that are not sent yet are now marked in the timeline
> * You can now knock on a room using /knock
