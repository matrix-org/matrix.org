Greetings Matrix fans! We've published Synapse [version 1.77](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.77.0)
as the new stable release this week. Synapse admins are encouraged to upgrade
to it at their convenience.

## The new stuff

### Experimental support for intentional mentions (MSC3952)

Mentioning other users on Matrix is difficult: it is not possible to know if mentioning a user
by display name or Matrix ID will count as a mention, but is also too easy to mistakenly mention a user.

[MSC3952](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3952) proposes a solution. Its idea is to make the mentioning explicit in the protocol using a dedicated event property,
instead of relying on searching the body of the message as before.

Synapse now implements this as an experimental feature.

### Experimental support to suppress notifications from message edits (MSC3958)

Have you ever been annoyed by a noisy notification that keep coming back, but you can't pinpoint
where it's coming from?
This is usually because edits to a message where you are mentioned (or that mention `@room`) will
retrigger a noisy notification. That can be pretty annoying when the message is edited 10 times!

[MSC3958](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3958)
is here to solve that, and Synapse now implements it as an experimental feature.

### The quest for speed continues!

Some iterative optimizations have been implemented that should make [joining or leaving](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/14971)
large rooms even faster, and should also [improve sending message](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/14962).

## Everything else

See the full [changelog](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.77.0), for a

order) icp1994, dklimpel, Fizzadar and realtyem.

We are also grateful to anyone helping us make Synapse better by sharing their
feedback and reporting issues, or helping with community support questions.
