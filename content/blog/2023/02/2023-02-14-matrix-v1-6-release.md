Hey all,

[Matrix 1.6](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/) is out there! Like Matrix 1.5 [back in November](https://matrix.org/blog/2022/11/17/matrix-v-1-5-release), this release is largely a maintenance update. Matrix 1.1 through 1.4 have been relatively major upgrades, so a little time between features doesn’t feel like a bad idea :)

As with all spec releases, we encourage implementations to gradually update over the next few months rather than have support for everything on release day - please be kind to the projects you use, and help them gain support if able.

Matrix 1.6 sees just 7 MSCs get merged, though this is to be expected from a maintenance release. Check out [Matthew’s Matrix 2.0 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUPJ9zFV5IE) at FOSDEM for an idea of what’s expected over the next few releases.

We’ve covered a couple of the MSCs below, but read on to the full changelog for the full picture.

## MSC3030: Jump to date API

_It’s here! The time machine we’ve been waiting for! _

Primarily part of the [Gitter feature parity project](https://github.com/vector-im/roadmap/issues/26) (congratulations to the team [going all-in on Matrix](https://blog.gitter.im/2023/02/13/gitter-has-fully-migrated-to-matrix/), by the way) to drive the [Matrix Public Archive](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-public-archive), the [new API](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv1roomsroomidtimestamp_to_event) gives clients the ability to jump back in time to a nearby event. Being able to find something that was posted on a given day/week, but not being sure of which keywords to look for is a major usability improvement - many thanks to the Gitter team for making Matrix better!


## MSC3706: Faster joins (part 1)

_Matrix is going voom_

[Synapse 1.76](https://matrix.org/blog/2023/01/31/synapse-1-76-released) enabled faster joins by default, and while there’s a lot of Python going into making joins as fast as possible, the specification side is a relatively small change at the moment: [just don’t send as many events during joins](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/server-server-api/#put_matrixfederationv2send_joinroomideventid) (`omit_members`).

There’s potentially more work on the horizon for making faster joins even faster and more robust, and some of that might involve spec work: keep an eye on Synapse releases and [TWIM](https://matrix.org/blog/category/this-week-in-matrix) for updates as we make our way to faster joins in Matrix 2.0 :)


## The full changelog

MSCs are how the spec changes in the way it does - adding, fixing, and maintaining features for the whole ecosystem to use. Check out the full changelog below, and the [Spec Change Proposals](https://spec.matrix.org/proposals/) page for more information on how these MSCs got merged (hint: they submitted a proposal, which anyone can do - take a look at the [Matrix Live episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFkZz60RRfc) where Matthew covers the proposal process).
