## Dept of Spec 📜

[TravisR](https://matrix.to/#/@travis:t2l.io) announces

> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <https://spec.matrix.org/proposals>
>
>
> ## MSC Status
>
> **Merged MSCs:**
>
> * [MSC3925: m.replace aggregation with full event](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3925)
>
> **Closed MSCs:**
>
> * [MSC2000: Server-side password policies](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2000)
>
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
>
> * *No MSCs are in FCP.*
>
> **New MSCs:**
>
> * [MSC3970: Scope transaction IDs to devices](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3970)
> * [MSC3969: Size limits](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3969)
> * [MSC3968: Poorer features](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3968)
>
> ## Spec Core Team
>
> In terms of Spec Core Team MSC focus for this week, we've been aiming to get the requirements for [MSC3952: Intentional Mentions](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3952) landed as well as discussing MSC3952 itself, in addition to planning out what the next few spec releases are expected to look like.
>
> Watch this space for progress on the Matrix 2.0 MSCs and other critical path items :)
>
> ## Curated MSC of the week
>
> This week's ~~random~~ chosen MSC is [MSC3575: Sliding Sync](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3575)! It's one of the largest (or is the largest?) MSCs we've ever had, and dramatically changes how clients actually get updates from the server. It's worth the read if you're a client developer, though the team working on it is ironing out some bugs. Let us know what you think on the MSC :)
>
> ## The Chart
>
> It seemingly was okay with being generated this week again, so here it is:

## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Synapse ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/))

Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team

[Shay](https://matrix.to/#/@shayshay:matrix.org) says

> Howdy, welcome to another week in Synapse-land. We've released  v1.78.0rc1
> with some cool bugfixes and features. Some notable additions in this version are:
>
> * Fixed a long-standing bug where the room aliases returned could be corrupted.
> * Fixed a bug introduced in Synapse 1.76.0 where partially-joined rooms could not be deleted using the [purge room API](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/admin_api/rooms.html#delete-room-api).
> * Fixed a long-standing bug where federated joins would fail if the first server in the list of servers to try is not in the room.
> * Implement the experimental `exact_event_match` push rule condition from [MSC3758](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3758).
> * Added account data to the command line [user data export tool](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.78/usage/administration/admin_faq.html#how-can-i-export-user-data)
>
> and much more! Take a closer look [here](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases) in the release notes and have a happy Friday.

### Construct ([website](https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct))

A performance-oriented homeserver with minimal dependencies.

[Jason Volk](https://matrix.to/#/@jevolk:matrix.org) reports

> There's been progress in several areas for Construct 0.9 this week, cut with 71 new commits. First I'd like to give special thanks for @bgiovanni for continuing to drive the progress this week; they have on several occasions been able to navigate the codebase and the specification to provide concise reports so I can fix anything in mere minutes. I hope we can keep this up.
>
> Construct can now be configured to purge a room from the database after the last local user leaves. This week I also took the plunge on implementing a controversial clause in the specification which requires a server to broadcast a join event on behalf of another server. This is problematic because it's technically an amplification attack, so I've done my best to narrow the conditions for when to actually perform this: only if the counter-party is not already joined, and only if Construct has an alias set for the room being joined.
>
> In other news, I [fixed a bug](https://github.com/chriskohlhoff/asio/pull/1215) in `boost::asio` but since that won't land for a while and Construct's `io_uring(7)` might be susceptible on Arch and Gentoo [I hacked a workaround](https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct/commit/884c2e68b71c92d223d312f60f35b9be81960a8c) just for us, especially since the old `epoll(7)` + `aio(7)` makes my desktop much less responsive (I can't believe I dealt with that for years!).
>
> Next week Yan Minari might have a deeper look at Sytest and Complement integration and maybe mdad, while I plan on implementing local room policies and user management to make Construct safe for public registration.
>
> If you're looking for an alternative to synapse please check us out at [#construct:zemos.net](https://matrix.to/#/#construct:zemos.net)

### Fractal ([website](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal))

Matrix messaging app for GNOME written in Rust.

[Kévin Commaille](https://matrix.to/#/@zecakeh:tedomum.net) says

> Hello all! Fractal 4.4.2-beta2 is available on Flathub Beta.
>
> You read correctly, it's not Fractal 5 yet. This is a maintenance release that fixes the compilation of Fractal 4.4 with recent libraries and allows to build the Flatpak with the latest GNOME runtime. That means no more warning that the GNOME 41 runtime is outdated!
>
> There are no new features, but since we updated a lot of Rust dependencies we preferred to release a beta version before using it to update our stable release to the latest runtime. So please test it and if no major regression is reported, we will release it as stable in two weeks.
>
> To get it, run the following commands:
>
> ```sh
> flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub-beta https://flathub.org/beta-repo/flathub-beta.flatpakrepo
> flatpak install flathub-beta org.gnome.Fractal
> flatpak run --branch=beta org.gnome.Fractal
> ```
>
> Note that if you always want to use this beta version instead of the stable one, and run it from the icon in your launcher, you will need to change its desktop file to use the command in the last line.
>
> See you soon with some news regarding Fractal 5 hopefully!

## Dept of Non Chat Clients 🎛️

### matrix-migrate

[ben](https://matrix.to/#/@ben:acter.global) says

> Happy to announce a neat little CLI tool (built with rust, of course) to migrate your matrix rooms from one account to another: [matrix-migrate](https://github.com/acterglobal/matrix-migrate) is inspired by the [the EMS migrator](https://ems.element.io/tools/matrix-migration), but
>
> 1. is a nice little CLI tool, based on `matrix-rust-sdk`
> 2. allows for restarts (refreshes at the beginning)
> 3. it runs the operations async in parallel and is thus quite a bit faster

>
> Lots of great new features got released in the last two weeks. Here are the highlights:
>
> * Added: Tables of joined rooms and direct contacts
> * Added: New input for identities: Masquerade As Matrix ID (for AppService tokens)
> * Fixed: Knocking button didn't work ("Error: Content not JSON.")
>

## Dept of Widgets 🧩

### matrix-meetings

[Oliver Sand](https://matrix.to/#/@oliver.sand:matrix.org) reports

> After we had some great time at [FOSDEM](https://matrix.org/blog/category/this-week-in-matrix#fosdem-2023) and where we were able to test our [Barcamp widget](https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-barcamp) with a broader group, we are thrilled to announce that we finally made the next widget public:
>
> Entering the [*matrix-meetings-widget*](https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-meetings)!
> The widget allows to plan meetings, invite other users, configure meetings rooms, view your calendar, and perform video conferences.
> All data is stored in Matrix, no external service required. As the Widget API is a bit limited for this use-cases, it's a combination of a widget and a bot.
>
> As a small teaser: We are in the progress of building a whiteboard widget that is fully based on Matrix without an external storage.
> If you have any questions, reach out to us at [#nordeck:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#nordeck:matrix.org).

## Dept of Bots 🤖

### mnotify

[stefan](https://matrix.to/#/@rumpelsepp:hackbrettl.de) announces

> Since there are people out there who actually use my tool for writing bots, I revived [mnotify](https://github.com/rumpelsepp/mnotify/) and started rewriting it in Rust using the `matrix-rust-sdk`. As a consequence, E2EE now works out of the box! Thanks to vadozemac builds without external C libraries are possible! If you are familiar with Rust and the matrix-rust-sdk, help is appreciated! 🙂

### rust pingbot

## Dept of Guides 🧭

[Andreas](https://matrix.to/#/@drakfrid:rimfaxe.net) says

> I wrote two blog posts ([one](https://rimfaxe.net/2023/02/23/en-guide-till-decentralisering/), [two](https://rimfaxe.net/2023/02/24/fler-fordelar-med-decentraliserade-natverk/)) about decentralization and its advantages over centralized networks (with some Matrix examples). It's in Swedish, but I hope some find it useful.
