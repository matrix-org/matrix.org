## Matrix Live

No Matrix Live today, but there will be a lot of Matrix content this weekend at
[FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org) in the [Matrix
devroom](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/track/matrix/), and [Matthew's
main-track talk](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/matrix20/).

## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Synapse ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/))

Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team

[dmr](https://matrix.to/#/@dmrobertson:matrix.org) announces

> I managed to find some time to commit [`lnav` configuration files for Synapse](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/tree/develop/contrib/lnav) this week. `lnav` is a log-viewing tool with too many bells and whistles for its own good. I particularly like it because it can interleave multiple log files by timestamp, and highlight log lines based on their severity. If you spend a lot of time looking at logs, these things can lower your blood pressure. Take a look if you think you'd find it useful.

[Shay](https://matrix.to/#/@shayshay:matrix.org) announces

> Hello TWIM! It's another week and here at Synapse we released
> v1.76.0. The big news for this release is that faster joins are now
> enabled by default. It has arrived 🚀! In addition, some other notable
> features are:
>
> * Updated the default room version to v10
> * Added a `set_displayname()` method to the module API for setting a user's display name
> * Implemented support for [MSC3890](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3890): Remotely silence local notifications
> * Implemented experimental support for [MSC3930](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3930): Push rules for ([MSC3381](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3381)) Polls
> * Add index to improve performance of the `/timestamp_to_event` endpoint used for jumping to a specific date in the timeline of a room
>
> and much more! You can read all about it [here](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.76.0). Also, please note that the upgrade from 1.75 to 1.76 changes the account data replication streams in a backwards-incompatible manner. Server operators running a multi-worker deployment should consult [the upgrade notes](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.76/docs/upgrade.md#changes-to-the-account-data-replication-streams).

## Dept of Clients 📱

### Nheko ([website](https://nheko-reborn.github.io))

Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.

[Nico](https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev) reports

> We did a lot of work on our markdown input this week. mauke finally fixed those pesky links with a closing parenthesis at the end from dropping that when linkified, without breaking links inside parentheses. Yes, it is still a regex and possibly outlawed in many civilized countries for having detrimental side-effects on society, but it works, so who am I to argue! Additionally we changed the newline behaviour (and fixed a bug related to line-breaks as well). A single line-break now corresponds to a line-break. You can find more about that decision [here](https://fosstodon.org/@deepbluev7/109771668066978726) and [here](https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/issues/757). You can opt out of that behaviour and other changes we do to the default cmark/commonmark behaviour using the new `/cmark` command. Speaking of other changes, we now support `||warning|spoiler||` as a way to enter spoilers, with the warning being optional as well as `~~text~~` for strike-through.
>
> There is also now a workaround for Wayland users, who were bothered by stuck menus. This still needs to be fixed in Qt eventually, but in the meantime you can now close menus by clicking somewhere inside of Nheko thanks to a contribution by enigma9o7. Decodetalkers also made Nheko clean up notifications on exit and the fullscreen image overlay hide, when the save dialog is open. You can create DMs by pasting an mxid again now. Previously you needed to delete and re-enter the last character... The username completer should also now open around twice as fast and clicking notifications now once again restores Nheko from the tray. The last goodie was contributed by Malte. The invite dialog inside a room can now search for users you have a DM open or the server side userdirectory for suggestions.

> Also, I am attending FOSDEM, so let's see if you can find me!

## Dept of VoIP 🤙

### Element Call ([website](https://call.element.io))

Native Decentralised End-to-end Encrypted Group Calls in Matrix, as a standalone web app

[MTRNord](https://matrix.to/#/@mtrnord:midnightthoughts.space) says

> #### Matrix Call Multitrack recorder
>
> Resulting from some past discussion of how matrix live may be improved, I did open <https://github.com/vector-im/element-call/issues/789> to support multitrack recordings of participants.
> However, it turns out this can quite easily be solved using a bot:
>
> Therefor <https://git.nordgedanken.dev/mtrnord/matrix-call-multitrack-recorder> has been created. This is an early alpha bot using matrix-nio which can participate in both legacy WebRTC matrix native calls and Element-Call style calls.
> Its purpose is to record each stream of a user to either a WAV or mp4 file.
>
> However, since this is very early, it should be noted there currently exist some UX issues and some features are missing.
>
> Feel free to give it a try or just join the Room: [#matrix-call-multitrack-recorder:midnightthoughts.space](https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-call-multitrack-recorder:midnightthoughts.space)
>
> Many thanks to t﻿u﻿l﻿i﻿r for <https://github.com/maubot/echortc> which helped to get a basic MVP rather quickly.

### matrix-rust-sdk ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk))

Next-gen crypto-included SDK for developing Clients, Bots and Appservices; written in Rust with bindings for Node, Swift and WASM

[ben](https://matrix.to/#/@gnunicorn:matrix.org) says

> ## [Matrix Rust SDK](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk)
>
> The last two weeks have all been under the rising star of FOSDEM this weekend and presenting the latest cool sh… stuff on Element-X. As such, the team has been busy—like really busy—improving the existing API for Sliding Sync and Timeline, adding fixes, like [duplicate message prevention](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1422), [various sliding sync internal fixes](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1418), [timeline reset](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1413), [fixes in the `VecDiff` generation](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1396) or [proper retries on decryption errors](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1412), and performance improvements, like [defer loading tracked users](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1382) or [reducing the cold cache size and time](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1441) and not the least adding [support for tracing via OpenTelemetry](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1428).
>
> Most profoundly sliding sync has been upgraded to the [latest JSON schema with named views](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1399) giving the team time to test that before shipping it to a wider audience post FOSDEM. In spirit of that, a first version of the [sqlite-based crypto-store has also been merged](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1390).

[msirringhaus](https://matrix.to/#/@msirringhaus:mozilla.org) announces

> A few years ago, I've written a small bot-api in Rust that used (and still uses) Fractals Matrix-implementation. Since that has been abandoned _quite_ a while ago, I wanted to look into porting my crate to the matrix-rust-sdk. As it turns out, there wouldn't really be any point in doing so. The SDK can be used more or less directly. Which I've learned, by writing a small [demo-bot](https://github.com/msirringhaus/matrix_exif_bot).
>
> This rather simple bot parses the exif-data of pictures that are posted, extracts the GPS-data (if available) and replies with a Matrix location-event for the image location. The plan was to do this with threads, but the SDK sadly doesn't support those. So good old replies it is.
> As a bonus, which turned out to be uglier than I thought, it'll also remove it's location-posts automatically, if the corresponding image gets removed.
> Configurable autojoin on invite and a command to leave are implemented as well.

## Dept of Events and Talks 🗣️
