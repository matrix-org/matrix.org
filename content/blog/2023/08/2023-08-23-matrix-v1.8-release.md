Hey all,

[Matrix 1.8](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.8/) is out now! The last release, [Matrix 1.7](https://matrix.org/blog/2023/05/25/matrix-v-1-7-release/), was full of features and laid out a plan for what Matrix 1.8 was expected to become. We spent most of our time focusing on the [MSC3995](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3995)-related MSCs from that original plan, but made an effort to get the other stuff looked at as well.

With this release we see a total of 9 MSCs achieve their formally adopted status. The full changelog at the bottom has all the details, but please read on for what’s new in room version 11, and Matrix 1.9’s roadmap :)


## Room version 11

Matrix 1.8 features a [new room version](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.8/rooms/v11/)! Normally a room version wouldn’t have a particular theme, but for v11 we aimed to clean up the different algorithms and event format details. After 10 prior room versions there were some artifacts of the past sticking around (but not causing problems necessarily) - many of them are cleaned up here.

Specified originally as [MSC3820](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3820), v11 introduces the following changes:



* [MSC2174](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2174) - Move `redacts` to the `content` of `m.room.redaction` events.
* [MSC2175](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2175) - Remove `creator` from `m.room.create` events (use `sender` instead).
* [MSC3989](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3989) - Remove `origin` from events.
* [MSC2176](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2176), [MSC3821](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3821) - General updates to redaction algorithm.

Alongside being a cleanup room version, v11 is the initial base we used for our efforts in the IETF world. It provides an easier starting point for new server implementations, particularly when paired with Linearized Matrix (described as both an [IETF Internet-Draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ralston-mimi-linearized-matrix-03) and [MSC3995](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3995)).

In future room versions the cleanup effort will continue, alongside additional features for supporting the IETF use cases. Watch this space for updates.


## Upcoming in Matrix 1.9

We’re continuing the trend of planning ahead and have the following themes planned for work in Matrix 1.9:



* Anything required by the MIMI/IETF efforts we’re undertaking. This currently includes:
    * Extensible Events
    * Role-Based Access Control (RBAC; new MSC expected)
    * Next generation of Linearized Matrix (already)
    * [MSC4044](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4044) and [MSC4045](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4045)
    * Binary-encoded events (maybe, but probable)
    * Canonical DMs (maybe)
    * Sending events as rooms/servers instead of just users (maybe)
    * Further room version cleanup as needed
* Merging [MSC3939](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3939).
* Accepting a combination of [MSC2545](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2545), [MSC1951](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1951), [MSC3892](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3892), and [MSC4027](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4027). This may involve creating a new MSC to cover the functionality of each, plus the needful for IETF and Extensible Events efforts.
* Merging [MSC3391](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3391) (time permitting).

A lot of this stuff might take the shape of opening MSCs or thinking about the problems, but we’re also very optimistic about getting them through FCP before November 2023. Watch this space for updates :)
