Following a series of stability issues, the [Libera.Chat team has requested that the Matrix <> Libera.Chat bridge be disabled](https://libera.chat/news/temporarily-disabling-the-matrix-bridge) until we can resolve the stability issues.

**From 14:00 UTC on Saturday 5th August the bridge will be unavailable.** We will be working to get the bridge back up as soon as we can, however, given the severity of the situation we do not expect immediate resolution.

We send our sincere apologies to anyone caught up in this decision and unable to reach folks on the Libera side.

Weâ€™ll get you back as soon as we can.
