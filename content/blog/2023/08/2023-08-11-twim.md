## Dept of Spec 📜

[TravisR](https://matrix.to/#/@travis:t2l.io) says

> # Spec
> 
> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <https://spec.matrix.org/proposals>.
> 
> 
> ## MSC Status
> 
> **New MSCs:**
> * [MSC4043: Presence Override API](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4043)
> * [MSC4042: Disabled Presence State](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4042)
> * [MSC4041: http header Retry-After for http code 429](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4041)
> 
> **MSCs proposed for Final Comment Period:**

> ## Spec Updates
> 
> We have a release date planned for Matrix 1.8! We're looking at **Wednesday, August 23rd, 2023**, and tracked as [issue #1614](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/issues/1614). Currently the only release blocker is room version 11, which should land well in advance of August 23rd. If there's other things we should be considering please raise them ASAP in [#sct-office:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org).
> 
> August 23rd also begins the Matrix 1.9 cycle where we'll be sticking to our MSC review plan more strongly. Stay tuned to TWIM for news on the exact MSCs/features we'll be looking at for that cycle, and let us know in [#sct-office:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org) if you think we should consider something in our planning.
> 
> The SCT has otherwise been thinking a lot about the MIMI working group at the IETF and how the protocol layering works there. About half of the SCT is going to take a break from MSC review over the next few weeks to ensure the protocol we're designing for MIMI will be fully compatible with Matrix - this will mean that some MSCs will move slower through FCP, sorry. 
> 
> As always, if you have questions, concerns, complaints, etc then let us know in [#sct-office:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org) 🙂

[TravisR](https://matrix.to/#/@travis:t2l.io) also announces

### Synapse ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/))

Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team

[Shay](https://matrix.to/#/@shayshay:matrix.org) says

> This week we released 1.90.0rc1.  Highlights include:
> 
> * Fix a long-standing bug where purging history and paginating simultaneously could lead to database corruption when using workers.
> * Scope transaction IDs to devices (implement [MSC3970](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3970)).
> * Remove support for legacy application service paths
> * Fix a long-standing bug where the `synapse_port_db` failed to configure sequences for application services and partial stated rooms
> 
> and much more. If you'd like to take a deep dive into the changes, you can find the release notes [here](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases) and as always, if you encounter a bug feel free to report it at https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/new/choose.

[f0x](https://matrix.to/#/@f0x:pixie.town) notes

> Recently added a Synapse worker to handle `~ ^/_matrix/federation/v1/send/` (which I apparently forgot back when I added all the other workers), and it resulted in huge performance improvements after my homeserver was getting absolutely trashed by incoming EDU's. Also now survived zfs trim running quite well, which I usually cancel halfway because it impacts disk so much Synapse becomes rather unusable.

### Conduit ([website](https://conduit.rs))

Conduit is a simple, fast and reliable chat server powered by Matrix

[Timo on Conduit ⚡️](https://matrix.to/#/@timo:conduit.rs) announces

> #### Announcing Conduit v0.6.0
> 
> Hey everyone, it's been a long time since the last stable Conduit release, but v0.6.0 has finally been released. It's the biggest update yet, adding support for threads, spaces, edit history, backfilling and much more, along with other improvements like automatic corruption recovery, check out <https://conduit.rs/changelog> for more information.
> 
> It's becoming harder and harder to notice missing features, the biggest one is being unable to join rooms with old room versions. You should give Conduit a try if you haven't already!
> 
> To update, simple replace the binary and restart. If it worked, you should receive a message in your admin room.
> 
> I currently work on Conduit in my free time, you can support me on <https://liberapay.com/timokoesters>

## Dept of Clients 📱

### Nheko ([website](https://nheko-reborn.github.io))

Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.

[Nico](https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev) announces

> I have been away travelling for so long, that I forgot what I last posted an update on, so I'll just summarize what happened recently!
> 
> Nheko now shows an indicator for moderators and admins in the timeline. Don't be confused if that mismatches the definition in Element, we don't hardcode specific powerlevels so our definition is slightly different. We also removed the last remnants of Qt Widgets in our code and are now relying only on Qml (apart from parts where Qt uses widgets as the fallback). Nheko now also compiles against {fmt} version 10 and the macOS intel nightlies should work again. You can now also mark a room as read from the room list, Nheko should not break on rooms without a creator anymore and reactions should render smoothly again.
> 
> Outside of that, people might have met me at FrOScon, where I popped up randomly and gave a surprise talk to everyone including me and I also stole some food at the Matrix User Meetup in Berlin. If you are attending the Chaos Camp, you might be able to catch me there soon or you can possibly also spot me at the Matrix summit in September. Let's see if I get to finish any code until then...
> 
> That's all and let's hope I can make my way through the backlog of open PRs soon!

### FluffyChat ([website](https://fluffychat.im))


[Krille-chan](https://matrix.to/#/@krille:janian.de) says

> That was some hard work in the last weeks. FluffyChat's migration to Github meant that I need to rewrite the whole CI/CD setup. And some blockers on the Linux version of FluffyChat didn't let me sleep last night. But at least the iOS version is now working and so I am proud to present FluffyChat v1.13.0 with some new features and minor design changes.
> 
> <https://github.com/krille-chan/fluffychat/releases/tag/v1.13.0>
> 
> **ALL CHANGES:**
> 
> * feat: option to not send typing notifications (Bnyro)
> * feat: small performance tweaks for Message (gilice)
> * feat: New onboarding screen with SSO as first class feature
> * feat: Import/Export emoji packs from/to zip file
> * fix: Set iOS badge (Krille)
> * refactor: Switch the dev hosting platform from GitLab to GitHub
> * design: New more compact chat bubble design and other design tweaks
> * design: Login now shows SSO more prominent and deprecates in-app registration in favor of SSO registration
> * Translated using Weblate (Arabic) (Rex_sa)
> * Translated using Weblate (Chinese (Simplified)) (Poesty Li)
> * Translated using Weblate (Estonian) (Priit Jõerüüt)
> * Translated using Weblate (German) (nautilusx)

> * Translated using Weblate (Ukrainian) (Ihor Hordiichuk)

### Element X iOS ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios))

A total rewrite of Element-iOS using the Matrix Rust SDK underneath and targeting devices running iOS 16+.

[Ștefan](https://matrix.to/#/@stefan.ceriu:matrix.org) reports

> Exciting week for Element X iOS as release `1.2.2` went out and `1.2.3` is hot on its heels. We have a lot of new features, improvements and bug fixes that will make the app (even more of) a joy to use. As always, you can check the full release notes [here](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios/releases).
> 
> This week we:
> * Improved how responsive the timeline action menu is to toggle
> * Started parsing the latest room message displayed in the room list and render it accordingly
> * Re-enabled and simplified the background app refresh
> * Re-enabled room list caching and offline support
> * Fixed issues around modal presentations and deep linking from notifications
> * Fixed crashes when trying to reply to media timeline items
> * Made good progress on [polls](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios/pull/1474)
> * and more great fixes coming out of the SDK
> 
> Stay tuned, even more exciting times ahead!

### Element X Android ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-android))

Android Matrix messenger application using the Matrix Rust Sdk and Jetpack Compose 

[Jorge](https://matrix.to/#/@jorgem:element.io) announces

> This week on Android we've been focusing on ironing out several critical bugs:
> * We had crashes in async Rust functions caused by a bug in the included Rust SDK version.
> * Rust and Android logs weren't being properly formatted and sent in rageshakes.
> * Fixed several stability issues around the sync process.
> * Notifications should now be more reliable, and we also don't display fallback notifications anymore for events that couldn't be fetched by the Rust SDK.
> 
> In other news, we've also:
> * Worked in standardising our design components following Compound, so you'll notice several UI and UX changes that should make Android, iOS and web look more consistent.
> * Started bringing polls to EAX.
> * Made the initial planning for integrating Element Call into the app.

### Element Web/Desktop ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-web))

Secure and independent communication, connected via Matrix. Come talk with us in [#element-web:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#element-web:matrix.org)!

[Danielle](https://matrix.to/#/@daniellekirkwood:one.ems.host) reports

> * This week on Web… We’ve been making progress on our updates to the room header and right panel. Check out our changes by using the Labs flag from Element Nightly or Develop. 
>   - We’re aiming to simplify our product in order to make it more accessible and user friendly overall. It’s an exciting time and evolution.
> * We’re working on stuck notifications; this week turning our attention to the automated tests. Ensuring that tests are set up and clearly define the behaviour that we want means that it’ll be easier for us to identify mis-steps in the future.

### Element Call ([website](https://call.element.io))

Native Decentralised End-to-end Encrypted Group Calls in Matrix, as a standalone web app

[Florian Heese](https://matrix.to/#/@fheese:element.io) reports

> #### Hello from the VoIP team
> 
> We have a new Element Call release [v0.4.3](https://github.com/vector-im/element-call/releases/tag/v0.4.3). This time we concentrated mainly on bug fixes and polishing:
> 
> * fixing device selection bugs
> * preventing devices from sleeping during calls
> * Starting large calls auto-muted
> 
> Wait there is one more thing: We added the foundation for (media) end-to-end encryption which you can find and test in the developer settings. You can expect a major UX rework supporting proper end-to-end encryption handling soonTM.

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰



### Trixnity ([website](https://gitlab.com/trixnity/trixnity))

Multiplatform Kotlin SDK for Matrix

[Benedict](https://matrix.to/#/@benedict:imbitbu.de) reports

> Trixnity v3.10.0 has been released.
> 
> features/improvements:
> * Added `Room::createEventContent` to get some common information about the room like room version or room type
> * Added `Room::lastRelevantEventTimestamp` to sort rooms without fetching `TimelineEvent`s.
> * Removed async transactions. They were introduced, because realm only supports one transaction at a time. They led to some consistency issues, so they were removed. Another workaround for realm was found.
> * Reworked the cache (now called `ObserveableCache`) to be way more memory efficient and therefore faster (a former rework in v3.7.0 still had some memory issues)

### matrix-rust-sdk ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk))

Next-gen crypto-included SDK for developing Clients, Bots and Appservices; written in Rust with bindings for Node, Swift and WASM

[Jonas Platte](https://matrix.to/#/@jplatte:flipdot.org) announces

> New features:
> 
> * [Added support for MSC3814 - Dehydrated devices v2](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2349)
> * [Added `RoomList::entries_with_dynamic_filter`](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2392)
> * [Get the user-defined notification mode for a room and all rooms for which a user-defined rule exists](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2396)
> * [FFI: added an optional file layer for tracing](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2384)
> * [FFI: Allow sending polls](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2391)
> 
> Bug fixes:
> 
> * [Set content-length header when streaming HTTP request body](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2402)
> * [Fix the `Room::is_encrypted` method](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2405)
> * [Skip Sliding Sync `Response` if it's been received already](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2395)
> * [Sliding Sync: Add `m.room.member: $LAZY` in the require states of `visible_rooms`](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2390)

### Dimension ([website](https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-dimension))

An open source integration manager for matrix clients, like Element.

[TravisR](https://matrix.to/#/@travis:t2l.io) reports

> #### Dimension is archived
> 
> Unfortunately, I haven't had time in the last 1-2 years to maintain [Dimension](https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-dimension), and so it's been archived. Community members may have been aware that it's not been receiving maintenance for quite a while now, but the last step was to formally archive the project. 
> 
> For those not familiar, Dimension is (was) an integration manager: a UI for managing room-level integrations supported by Element. Typically available via "Add widgets, bridges & bots", the integration manager provides an easier way to configure such things, though the default one in Element does not support self-hosted bots & bridges at the moment. 
> 
> With this news, it's strongly recommended to *not* deploy Dimension in your infrastructure: there's more than 1 year's worth of undiagnosed security issues, and the project doesn't even run in most cases. Unfortunately, there are no open source alternatives at the moment either. Others are welcome to start their own replacement project, and I'd suggest not using Dimension as a base to get away from years of bad code/technical debt (sorry). 
> 
> Chances are you don't need an integration manager though:
> 
> * Widgets can be added to rooms with Element Web/Desktop with `/addwidget`
> * Self-hosted bots and bridges can be managed entirely by commands
> * Stickers are best supported by <https://github.com/maunium/stickerpicker> and alternative clients like Nheko
> 
> If you have questions or concerns, [#dimension:t2bot.io](https://matrix.to/#/#dimension:t2bot.io) will live on as a room, but support will not be provided.
