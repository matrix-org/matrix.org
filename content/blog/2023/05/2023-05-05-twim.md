> Lots of MSCs moving through the pipeline this week! Plus a myriad of [spec changes](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) too! The spec seems to be gently humming along.
> 
> In other news, the next release of the spec, v1.7, is coming up in the not-too-distant future. In keeping with our roughly quarterly release schedule - the release of v1.6 was on February 14th, 2023 - a new release of the spec should come some time in next few weeks.
> 
> We haven't set a date yet, but expect to do so soon. So watch this space!
> 
> ## Random MSC of the Week
> 
> The random MSC of the week is... [MSC3741: Revealing the useful login flows to clients after a soft logout](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3741)!
> 
> This MSC fixes an edge case in the spec. Imagine the following scenario. You're logged into your homeserver via an SSO flow (let's say by signing into GitLab), and then you try to change your password on GitLab. Doing so may cause a "soft logout" to occur for your Matrix client. A soft logout, by the way, happens when your access token is invalidated, but your client is told explicitly not to wipe its local state (including encryption keys).
> 
> Your Matrix client is telling you to log back in again, and in doing so calls out to the [`GET /_matrix/client/v3/login`](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv3login) endpoint to see what login methods are available. Your homeserver supports both password-based and SSO-based login, so that's what you get back. Your client happily presents you both options. You try to type your GitLab password, but it's incorrect. And you've just given your GitLab password to this Matrix homeserver in plaintext - oh no!
> 
> The problem here stems from the fact that `GET /login` is unauthenticated. The homeserver doesn't know who you are when you attempt to log in again, and thus can't tailor the available login methods to those that make sense for you. This MSC aims to fix this by having your Matrix client, upon trying to learn how to log in again after a soft logout, provide your expired access token in an `Authorization` request header. The homeserver can then check and see that 1) you were just soft logout'd and 2) you are an account that is authorised via SSO - so it doesn't make sense to suggest you log in again via a password specific to your Matrix homeserver!
> 
> While this MSC discusses a valuable solution, it is worth considering that the [User-Interactive Authentication system](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/client-server-api/#user-interactive-authentication-api) as a whole is going to be completely replaced by OpenID Connect instead, which will make this problem (and solution) moot. Still, that day is not here yet, so if you suffer from this problem today, this may be one method to deal with it.

## Dept of Clients 📱

### Quadrix ([website](https://github.com/alariej/quadrix))

A Minimal, simple, multi-platform chat client for the Matrix protocol.

[JFA](https://matrix.to/#/@alariej:matrix.org) says

> Version 1.6.5 of Quadrix (Matrix client for mobiles and desktops) has been released and is available in the respective app stores.
> 
> The latest changes include the replacement of the Jitsi Meet videoconferencing functionality with an embedded version of Element Call, using matrix-widget-api. Quadrix loads the Element Call web app located at https://element-call.netlify.app, which is the continually updated dev version. The Quadrix implementation is not quite compatible with Element Web, since it uses non-encrypted WebRTC signalling, but that's something I'll be working on in the next weeks.
> 
> Please go test-drive Element Call in Quadrix and leave feedback/comments at [#quadrix:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#quadrix:matrix.org) or in the issues at https://github.com/alariej/quadrix (stars welcome :-)

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰

### libolm 🦎 ([website](https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm))

[uhoreg](https://matrix.to/#/@hubert:uhoreg.ca) says

> libolm is an implementation of the Olm and Megolm cryptographic ratchets used for end-to-end encryption in Matrix.  libolm 3.2.15 has been released.  This is mainly a maintenance release that improves the Python packaging and fixes a TypeScript issue.  The biggest change is that the Python package can now be installed from pypi.org, the default repository for Python packages.  The source package includes the libolm sources, so you do not need libolm to be installed separately any more.  All you need is cmake (or possibly GNU make) and a C/C++ compiler, and run `pip install python-olm`.  It unfortunately does not yet work on Windows, but should work on UNIX-like operating systems such as Linux and \*BSD, and even macOS.
> 
> In other news: with Element iOS and Element Android switching to the rust crypto SDK, and hence using vodozemac, I'm considering deprecating the iOS and Android bindings for libolm.  If you still need those bindings, please let me know.

## Dept of Ops 🛠

### MatrixRooms.info ([website](https://matrixrooms.info/))

A developers-managed instance of the standalone search engine built for matrix rooms discovery.

[Aine](https://matrix.to/#/@aine:etke.cc) reports

> During this week at [etke.cc](https://etke.cc/?utm_source=twim) we polished the Matrix Rooms Search service and implemented the following improvements:
> 
> * Enabled language detection for all (75) supported languages and language analysis for all (29) supported languages by search engine
> * Added ability to report illegal rooms (please, keep in mind that we know nothing about the contents of the indexed rooms, so if you think something is illegal - describe it like ELI5, so anyone can read the reason and know for sure if that room should be removed or not)
> * Optimized avatars processing on UI
> 
> Current index status: **233513** indexed rooms from **19919** matrix servers
> 
> One more thing - we've created [Liberapay team](https://liberapay.com/mrs) to crowdfund the project's existence and we welcome everyone to donate and fund the future development and infrastructure costs 🙂
