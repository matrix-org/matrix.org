Building on last year's success, the Matrix.org Foundation is excited to host a Matrix.org Foundation and Community devroom in person this year again at FOSDEM. Half a day of talks, demos and workshops around Matrix itself and projects built on top of Matrix.

We encourage people working on the Matrix protocol or building on it in an open source project to submit a proposal! Note that companies are welcome to talk about the Matrix details of their open source projects, but marketing talks are not welcome.

<!-- more -->

Key dates are:

- Conference dates 3-4 February, 2024
- Matrix Devroom is likely going to be on Sunday afternoon, to be confirmed by FOSDEM soon
- Submission deadline: Monday 4th December
- Announcement of selected talks: Friday 15th December

You must be available in person in Brussels to present your talk.

## Talk Details

The talks can follow one of the two formats:

- 20 min talk + 10 min Q&A, for topics that can be covered briefly
- 50 min talk + 10 min Q&A for more complex subjects which need more focus

We strongly encourage you to prepare a demo when it makes sense, so people can actually see what your work looks like in practice.

Of course, the proposal must respect the FOSDEM terms as well:

> The conference language is English. All content must relate to Free and Open Source Software. By participating in the event you agree to the publication of your recordings, slides and other content provided under the same licence as all FOSDEM content (CC-BY).

## Submitting a Proposal

Proposals must be submitted on FOSDEM's conference management system: <https://pretalx.fosdem.org/>. Heads up that this year FOSDEM is not relying on the good old Pentabarf but on Pretalx. All submissions must go through pretalx: <https://fosdem.org/submit>

We expect to receive more requests than we have slots available. The devroom organisers will be reviewing the proposals and accepting them based on the potential positive impact the project has on Matrix, as defined in the Mission section of <https://matrix.org/foundation>.

If a project proposal has been turned down, it doesn't mean we don't believe it has good potential. Maintainers are invited to join the <https://matrix.to/#/#twim:matrix.org> Matrix room to give it some visibility.
