## Dept of Spec 📜

[Andrew Morgan (anoa)](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io) says

> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <https://spec.matrix.org/proposals>.
> 
> ## MSC Status
> 
> **New MSCs:**
> * [MSC4038: Key backup for MLS](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4038)
> 
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
> * *No MSCs are in FCP.*
> 
> **Accepted MSCs:**
> * [MSC3291: Muting in VoIP calls](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3291)
> 
> **Closed MSCs:**
> * *No MSCs were closed/rejected this week.*
> 
> ## Spec Updates
> 
> This week we have been preparing for IETF117, Matrix 1.8, Matrix 1.9, and [Messaging Layer Security (MLS) for Matrix](https://matrix.org/blog/2023/07/a-giant-leap-with-mls/). Most of our work on globally interoperable communications is ongoing through the More Instant Messaging Interoperability (MIMI) working group at the IETF, and will be making significant strides in the coming days as we head to the IETF117 [hackathon](https://wiki.ietf.org/en/meeting/117/hackathon#linearized-matrix) and [meetup](https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/117/). 
> 
> Over the last few months we've been working on a version of [Linearized Matrix](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ralston-mimi-linearized-matrix/) which supports the simplicity of linear event history while being fully compatible with today's Matrix network, and while we think that the 03 draft we wrote up accomplishes a lot of this, there's further work to be done to make it cleaner and easier to use. We've also been writing implementations of it to prove the semantics (and find areas which need improvement), starting with our cleanroom [eigen-server](https://github.com/matrix-org/eigen-server) TypeScript implementation and interoperating it with a branch of Synapse. During IETF117 we expect more implementations to sprout and have their interoperability tested - watch this space for updates on how that goes.
> 
> Aside from IETF117, we're continuing to look at the previously-selected Matrix 1.8 MSCs for release in mid-late August 2023. This might be slow over the next couple of weeks while half of us are at IETF117, but expect more forward progress when we get back. Matrix 1.9 is scheduled to be released sometime in November 2023, and a few months ago we said we were aiming to plan ahead for releases a bit more deliberately. Starting this week, we're accepting submissions for ideas and specific MSCs which need our attention in Matrix 1.9. If you have an MSC (current or future) which will need Spec Core Team (SCT) attention between August 2023 and November 2023, let us know in the [SCT Office](https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org) room. Once Matrix 1.8 is released (exact date TBD) we will have limited availability to add things to the Matrix 1.9 target - please raise your MSCs & themes as soon as possible. The current set of MSCs up for consideration can be found on the [SCT Intake Board](https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/88).
> 
> If you've made it this far in our weekly update, congratulations, and thank you. We expect things will rapidly start to happen with IETF117 kicking off tomorrow (July 22, 2023), and we will do our best to keep folks updated. Next week's TWIM in particular will have a post-IETF117 debrief for your reading enjoyment :)
> 
> As always, if you have any questions or concerns about what we're working on, visit the [SCT Office](https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org) and let us know. We can't promise a prompt reply (particularly during IETF117), but we will take a look when we can.
> 
> ## Random MSC of the Week
> 
> The random MSC of the week is... [MSC3105: Previewing UIA flows](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3105)!
> 
> This MSC addresses a shortcoming in the current [User-Interactive Authentication](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.7/client-server-api/#user-interactive-authentication-api) (UIA) mechanism where attempting to deduce the required authentication flows for an action will result in that action being carried out if it turns out no flows were required. This makes it tricky for a client to present a "are you sure you want to do X?" as a final step in completing an action that requires authentication.
> 
> The proposals aims to allow an OPTIONS pre-flight HTTP request to the same endpoint in order to retrieve the flows necessary, without actually carrying out the action. The proposal does note that using OPTIONS for this case is a bit non-standard though, and some clients may treat the typical `401` error code returned during User-Interactive Auth as a fatal error.
> 
> While this does address a flaw in the UIA system, it's worth noting that many other flaws exist! Matrix is planning to move over to an OpenID Connect-based authentication system in the not too distant future, which will likely have far fewer edge cases than our traditional, home-grown one. You can visit <https://areweoidcyet.com/> for more information and to track the current progress on that front.

## Dept of Servers 🏢



### Synapse ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/))

Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team

[Shay](https://matrix.to/#/@shayshay:matrix.org) reports

> This week we released 1.88.0. First, an announcement: Please note that this release
> 
> * raises the minimum supported version of Python to 3.8, as Python 3.7 is now [end-of-life](https://devguide.python.org/versions/) and
> * removes deprecated config options related to worker deployment.
> 
> See [the upgrade notes](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v1.88/docs/upgrade.md#upgrading-to-v1880) for more information. Now the highlights:
> 
> * Remove deprecated `worker_replication_host`, `worker_replication_http_port` and `worker_replication_http_tls` configuration options.
> * Pin `pydantic` to `^=1.7.4` to avoid backwards-incompatible API changes from the 2.0.0 release
> * Correctly resize thumbnails with pillow version >=10
> * Add `not_user_type` param to the [list accounts admin API](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.88/admin_api/user_admin_api.html#list-accounts)
> * Use lower isolation level when cleaning old presence stream data to avoid serialization errors
> 
> and much more. If you'd like to take a deep dive into the changes, you can find the release notes [here](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases) and as always, if you encounter a bug feel free to report it at <https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/new/choose>.

## Dept of Bridges 🌉

### mautrix-gmessages

[tulir](https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net) announces

> There's a Google Messages bridge now for bridging RCS (and normal SMS/MMS too): <https://github.com/mautrix/gmessages>
> 
> Since Google's RCS is basically completely proprietary and doesn't have any real interoperability (despite what they want you to think), the only way to bridge it is to act as the Messages for Web app. It's also a much more reliable way of bridging SMS from an Android phone, because the Messages app on Android has access to all of Google's cheat codes to avoid being killed/limited by the OS.

## Dept of Clients 📱

### FluffyChat ([website](https://fluffychat.im))



[Krille-chan](https://matrix.to/#/@krille:janian.de) reports

> FluffyChat took a little development break to migrate to Github. However I hope that this improves some flows after all and makes releases more stable in the future. Stay tuned ❤️

### Element X iOS ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios))

A total rewrite of Element-iOS using the Matrix Rust SDK underneath and targeting devices running iOS 16+.

[Ștefan](https://matrix.to/#/@stefan.ceriu:matrix.org) says

> We're continuing our bug fixing spree following the App Store release:
> 
> * massive improvements to the timeline and message rendering
> * redaction is now supported for group moderators
> * fixed bugs around pasting media into the message composer
> * blocked members are now updated accordingly
> * improvements to how to exercise the sync loop
> * fixed thumbnails for portrait videos
> * fixed alert and dialog tint colors throughout the app
> * fixed tint colors in dark mode
> * fixed incorrect file reply icons
> * and we have promoted location sharing from behind a feature flag and made it available to all

[Danielle](https://matrix.to/#/@daniellekirkwood:one.ems.host) announces

> * Stuck notifications improvements are here! We’re making some significant improvements in the area of stuck notifications that some users have been experiencing. We aren’t taking our foot off the pedal though, we still have some pesky things to iron out and are continuing to work on these.
> * For our accessibility work, we’re making great progress on color this week. If you use our Develop or Nightly instances you’ll have seen the changes already. We’re increasing contrast throughout the app, improving legibility and reducing eye strain.

## Dept of Encryption 🔐

### Messaging Layer Security

[uhoreg](https://matrix.to/#/@hubert:uhoreg.ca) reports

> [Messaging Layer Security (MLS)](https://messaginglayersecurity.rocks/) is now [RFC 9420](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9420/)!  MLS is an IETF standard for end-to-end encryption in messaging systems.  You can read the Matrix.org Foundation's blog post about the publication of MLS at <https://matrix.org/blog/2023/07/a-giant-leap-with-mls/>, and the IETF's blog post at <https://www.ietf.org/blog/mls-protocol-published/>.  We've been working on integrating MLS into Matrix via a proof-of-concept implementation in Element Web.  We have basic functionality working, and even key backup is working.  You can read more about our progress and view demo videos at <https://arewemlsyet.com>.

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰

### Trixnity ([website](https://gitlab.com/trixnity/trixnity))
