## Dept of Bridges 🌉

### Postmoogle ([website](https://gitlab.com/etke.cc/postmoogle))

An Email to Matrix bridge. 1 room = 1 mailbox.

[Aine](https://matrix.to/#/@aine:etke.cc) says

> **Introducing Postmoogle v0.9.16: Bridging Email and Matrix Like Never Before!**
> 
> We at [etke.cc](https://etke.cc/) are delighted to announce the release of Postmoogle v0.9.16, your trusted bridge for seamlessly connecting the worlds of email and Matrix. In this update, we've introduced a host of new features and enhancements to elevate your Matrix email experience.
> 
> Here's what's new in this release:
> 
> 1. **Emoji Support**: Express yourself with emojis! You can now react to emails with the ⛔️,🛑, or 🚫 emojis to add the sender to your spam list. Embrace a better quality of life change within your Matrix rooms.
> 2. **Subaddressing Support**: Postmoogle now offers support for subaddressing. Receive emails sent to addresses like `mailbox+anything@example.com`, giving you more control over your email routing.
> 3. **Enhanced Banlist Modes**: We've added two new server ban modes: `banlist:auth` and `banlist:auto`. The `banlist:auth` mode automatically bans users for attempting to authenticate into Postmoogle over SMTP with invalid credentials, while `banlist:auto` automatically bans for invalid emails, such as those failing MX, SPF, or DKIM checks. You can configure each mode separately, enhancing the security of your Matrix environment.
> 4. **Improved Banlist Output**: The `!pm banlist` command output has been improved to display bans per day in weekly chunks. This streamlined presentation makes it easier for you to monitor and manage banned IPs effectively.
> 5. **Enhanced Reply Handling**: Postmoogle now ensures that it always replies to your messages, either within the threads or using the reply-tos, depending on your mailbox configuration. This guarantees a more organized and threaded conversation experience within your Matrix rooms.
> 6. **Custom Mailbox Signatures**: The new `!pm signature` command enables you to set a personalized signature for your mailbox, adding a unique touch to your email messages.
> 7. **Automatic Replies**: With the introduction of the `!pm autoreply` command, you can configure automatic responses for all incoming emails without existing threads. This feature simplifies communication when receiving new email threads.
> 
> Postmoogle v0.9.16 brings you an enhanced email-to-Matrix bridge, bolstered security measures, and an improved quality of life. Whether you're managing email discussions within your Matrix rooms or responding to emails from your Matrix client, Postmoogle ensures a seamless integration.
> 
> Upgrade to Postmoogle v0.9.16 today and discover the future of email communication within the Matrix ecosystem. To get started, visit our [GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/etke.cc/postmoogle) or explore the [#postmoogle:etke.cc](https://matrix.to/#/#postmoogle:etke.cc)  room.

## Dept of Clients 📱

### Commet

A client packed with fun and convenient features.

[airyz](https://matrix.to/#/@airyz:matrix.org) announces

> Hello, world!
> 
> I'm excited to finally announce Commet! a new client for matrix! We are aiming to create a client that is packed with fun and convenient features, to help you connect with your friends.
> 
> We’ve been quietly in development over the past seven months and while we aren’t ready to call Commet stable, it is ‘stable enough’ to reveal it to the community
> 
> Despite being early in development, we have a few exciting features that help us stand out:
> 
> ### Built for multiple accounts
> Commet was built from the ground up to have great support for running multiple accounts at once.
> 
> ### GIF Search
> A Gif searcher in a matrix client?! We are running a proxy service for tenor, so you can easily send sarcastic gifs on matrix!
> 
> ### Custom Emotes / Stickers
> We support the same custom emotes implementation that you might be familiar with from other clients!
> 
> Thats all for now! Check us out on [github](https://github.com/commetchat/commet) or stop by [our room](https://matrix.to/#/#commet:matrix.org) and say hi!

### Neochat ([website](https://invent.kde.org/network/neochat))

A client for matrix, the decentralized communication protocol

[Tobias Fella](https://matrix.to/#/@tobiasfella:kde.org) says

> We've landed a major feature in NeoChat this week: There's a now a page showing the subspaces and rooms in a space. This also allows for basic space administration tasks, like adding new rooms to the space. Internally, our Qt6 port is progressing, with all major changes being done now.

### Element X iOS ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios))

A total rewrite of Element-iOS using the Matrix Rust SDK underneath and targeting devices running iOS 16+.

[Ștefan](https://matrix.to/#/@stefan.ceriu:matrix.org) says

> Busy week in Element X land:
>         
> * Following small tweaks [here](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios/pull/1819) and [there](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios/pull/1799) Polls are now officially finished! 🥳
> * Work has started on [support for voice messages](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios/pull/1776)
> * And also on [user mention pills](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios/pull/1797)
> * We can now reply to more types of room messages
> * Our unit tests are more stable and ever and our coverage is at all time high at [71.4%](https://app.codecov.io/gh/vector-im/element-x-ios)
> * And we fixed bugs around UI and Integration tests, the Element Call integration, iOS 17 and more

### Element X Android ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-android))

Android Matrix messenger application using the Matrix Rust Sdk and Jetpack Compose 

[benoit](https://matrix.to/#/@benoit.marty:matrix.org) announces

> * Element X Android will be released on the PlayStore - once Google approves it - with a fix for the crash about the Camera permission.
> * Polls are getting the latest design tweak, notification with the poll question is coming.
> * Open a room is smoother than before, some stuff have been move to worker thread.
> * The bloom effect will also be rendered faster.
> * We are adding test to reach the target of 60% of code coverage. We are not far!
> * The Rich Text Editor can now be displayed in full screen mode.
> * Next week we will start October features: Key backup management; pin and biometric unlock; voice message; and rendering pills in the timeline.

### Element Web/Desktop ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-web))

Secure and independent communication, connected via Matrix. Come talk with us in [#element-web:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#element-web:matrix.org)!

[Johannes Marbach](https://matrix.to/#/@johannesm:element.io) announces

> * We’re wrapping up some test stabilisation work on our notification test suite and will transition into fixing the failures next.
> * Visual regressions from the Compound adoption have mostly been fixed. We started applying a UI refresh to the right panel and are planning to unlabs it together with the room header once complete.
> * About 80% of our strings have been migrated over to Localazy. We’re getting close to finishing this off and reopening translations to contributors.
> * People living on the edge might have noticed that the Safari 17 update has broken our emoji fonts. We’re planning to put a hotfix together for this today. On the back of this we’re also considering doing away with bundled emoji fonts entirely and falling back to what the OS provides. The situation on this is looking much different these days compared to a few years ago.

## Dept of VoIP 🤙

### Calling for bridges

[Malte E](https://matrix.to/#/@malte:maltee.de) reports

> During the Matrix community summit, Timo K.and I discussed reducing friction for video calls with bridged users. Instead of true call bridging, which would likely be months of work, we implemented a workaround within less than a day. Starting an MSC3401 call from Matrix will send an element call link to the remote platform user, which will skip login and room selection, taking them straight to the call in two clicks (one for the link and one to confirm). On the Matrix side, the experience is seamless, once a few prerequisites have been met: the matrix client must use MSC3401 and because element web currently defaults to legacy calling in DMs, a third user, such as the bridge bot, must be present in the room. Furthermore, a modified element call instance is needed.
> We have so far implemented calls via Element Call for matrix -> Telegram in DMs. We will be working on solutions for incoming calls and group calls as well as support for other platforms.
> There is currently still a major security concern: To skip the login process, the link comes with a token for the ghost account. Anyone with access to the token - that includes the matrix user who started the call - will be able to log in with that ghost account. We invalidate the token once the call has ended, but that is obviously nowhere near sufficient. Scoped access tokens with permissions for sending and receiving call events in a single room for a limited time would be required. On platforms using Double Ratchet E2E, it should also be possible to use different plaintext for different recipients in the same message, thereby only exposing the token to those who already implicitly have authority over the ghost account through their account on the remote platform.
> 
> For those brave enough to try, you will need [this fork of mautrix-python](https://github.com/maltee1/mautrix-python/tree/calls), [this fork of mautrix-telegram](https://github.com/maltee1/mautrix-telegram/tree/calls)
> as well as [this fork of element call](https://github.com/vector-im/element-call/tree/call_bridge_token_url_param) or just use [the instance hosted here](https://pr1576--element-call.netlify.app). 
> In the bridge config.yaml, set `bridge.calls.enabled` to `true` and provide the element call instance in `bridge.calls.ec_url`.
> Be sure that you trust everyone with access your bridge before deploying, until we have figured out how to make it safer.
> 
> We apologize for the subpar audio and glitches. We had limited time and equipment to record the demo and will try to do better next time

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰

### Rory&::LibMatrix

[Emma [it/its]](https://matrix.to/#/@emma:rory.gay) says

> Not much changed this week:
> * Some refactors to how user identities are handled
> * Correction in function names to correctly display async vs non-async functions
> * `AuthenticatedHomeserverGeneric.GetRoom(string id)` is no longer async, since that is only a constructor call.
> * Sync code has gotten a slight cleanup
> * ` AuthenticatedHomeserverGeneric.WhoAmI` was turned into a property that only gets fetched when attempting to get the info for the first time, rather than fetching it when constructing the homeserver object.
> * Added a null check for `creationEvent.Invite` when callign `CreateRoom`
>   - This field was also made nullable
> * Renamed `canonicalHomeServerDomain` to `baseUrl` in the constructors for homeservers
> * `FullHomeServerDomain` and `HomeServerDomain` were removed from homeserver objects
> * Authentication was moved to a functions inside `RemoteHomeserver` rather than being service-only. This allows for usecases outside of Dependency Injection based applications
> * LoginResponse now tries to get homeserver canonical domain from mxid if not provided by the server (since this field is deprecated)
> * Removed an obsolete way to get room state without providing a type (can still pass `JsonElement` if required)
> * Fixed sending files in a room via `room.SendFileAsync`, this now does what you would expect instead of throwing an exception (because I'd written the wrong code)
> * Added `room.DisbandRoomAsync()` in the case you ever want to completely get rid of a room, ban everyone and make the room private
> * Added `AddChildAsync` to SpaceRoom, in order to allow adding space children
> * Removed TieredStorage arguments from homeserver constructor
> * Removed explicit http client creation for authenticated homeservers, in favor of re-using the one created in RemoteHomeserver
> * Fixed `room.SendMessageEventAsync` requiring an event type (this is always `m.room.message` afaik)
> * Moved namespace `LibMatrix.StateEventTypes.Spec` to `LibMatrix.EventTypes.Spec.State` in order to better represent what's in that folder
> * Increased coverage of MatrixHttpClient to include PUT requests
> * Removed TieredStorageService argument from SyncHelper (I might make SyncHelper not part of homeserver in the future so you can have separate sync loops with different filters)
> * GetRoom(string id) now has a check that the id needs to start with a `!`
> * Added a Logout function to AuthenticatedHomeserverGeneric so you can properly dispose a session
> * Added the ability to resolve room aliases
> * Last, but definitely not least, some unit tests have been added!
> 
> Non-code updates:
> * Unit tests are powered by an unfederated homeserver at matrixunittests.rory.gay - there is no data persistence
> 
> As always:
> * The code is available at [my git domain](https://git.rory.gay/matrix/LibMatrix.git/)
>   - If anyone wants to contribute a page to put there instead of a plain dumb git directory, please feel free to!
>   - All other contributions are more than welcome, be it documentation, code, anything!
> * Discussion is welcome in [#libmatrix:rory.gay](https://matrix.to/#/#libmatrix:rory.gay)

### Trixnity ([website](https://gitlab.com/trixnity/trixnity))

Multiplatform Kotlin SDK for Matrix

[Michael](https://matrix.to/#/@michael:imbitbu.de) announces

> We are happy to announce that Trixnity Messenger is open source now. It is a Kotlin multiplatform Matrix messenger SDK built on top of Trixnity. It defines a messenger client without specifying a UI layer (think of it as a headless messenger). All it provides is a series of view models that define the structure and logic of a messenger.
> It has never been easier to implement a Matrix messenger targeting multiple platforms such as Android, iOS, Desktop or the web. Just define how it should look - all the logic and nitty-gritty details are already accounted for. And if you do not like the behavior of the messenger in some parts, just extend or override the existing logic with your own. There is no need to fork the project.
> So join us at https://gitlab.com/connect2x/trixnity-messenger and in [#trixnity-messenger:imbitbu.de](https://matrix.to/#/#trixnity-messenger:imbitbu.de).

### Home Assistant - Matrix Integration

[Paarth Shah](https://matrix.to/#/@me:shahpaarth.com) announces

> I'm happy to announce that Home Assistant [2023.10 release](https://rc.home-assistant.io/blog/2023/09/27/release-202310/) (in beta at the time of writing) includes [my PR](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/72797) to refactor the included `matrix` integration to use `matrix-nio`! You can see the full changelog [here](https://rc.home-assistant.io/changelogs/core-2023.10#all-changes). As part of the merge, I've also become the code owner for the integration.
> 
> In the [2023-06-09 TWIM](https://matrix.org/blog/2023/06/09/this-week-in-matrix-2023-06-09/) I announced that I'd created [matrix-nio-hacs](https://github.com/PaarthShah/matrix-nio-hacs) as a stand-in while this had still been pending merge. As it will no longer be necessary, for those of you who have been using it, I'll eventually be archiving the repository since I now will be able to continue development directly on home assistant core. Any and all bug reports and/or PRs will be greatly appreciated!

### Mappo

[Janet Blackquill](https://matrix.to/#/@akesijan:toki.club) reports

> Hi, I present to y'all a little bot called Mappo.
> He's technically been around for a while, but I polished him up with some new Matrix features as of late to bring him closer to his presence on Discord, and I haven't really promoted it before.
> 
> He's a lil noodly jellyfish fella that lets you play the eponymous social deduction game of Mappo where some people are villagers and some people are creatures. The village is trying to figure out who the creatures are to exile them, but at the same time, the creatures are slowly picking them off, one-by-one until they outnumber them! Who wins is determined by who's the best at deducing the truth (or obfuscating it if you're one of the creatures!) The roles range from the conventional like the Seer and Werewolf to the wild and wacky like Cookie Person and Goose.
> 
> His source is located on GitHub at https://github.com/pontaoski/mappo. Mappo is unique for a bot due to being multi-protocol with a core logic speaking to an abstraction layer implemented for both Discord and Matrix. 
> 
> If you wanna check out Mappo in action, come stop by [#mappo:toki.club](https://matrix.to/#/#mappo:toki.club) and give the game a try with other people!

> That's right, a couple people were still alive on Sunday after one awesome Thursday of ~~[BarCamp](https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-barcamp/tree/nic/env/fosdem-2023)~~ [BarCamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp)ing and two more excellent days full of Matrix [programme](https://summit2023.matrixmeetup.de/conference/schedule/#2023-09-22) and programming across two stages and got together for some creative Matrix hacking!
> 
> We had a bunch of interesting projects, see the announcement about VoIP bridging from Malte E. and Timo K.
> Personally, I was involved in the ~~event T-Shirt creation~~ [revised MSC2997 implementation](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2997#discussion_r1335165880) with the wonderful [@c_atc:c-base.org](https://matrix.to/#/@c_atc:c-base.org). If you look at that more closely, you'll find there is an `mxc`-URL in the event body.

> Of course, entering it into your browser works ([how?](https://gitlab.com/matrix-meetup/matrixmeetup.de/-/merge_requests/3)), try it out!
> 
> The obvious idea was to also make it all work through matrix so that in the future, once other client's implement the event scheme, the event will properly work?
> But how would we set up a media on a defined media ID and ...could we circumvent having to set up it's own homeserver just for this gimmick, or even any additional infrastructure at all?
> 
> Luckily I was sitting next to the excellent [Nico from Nheko](https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev) and we started hacking!

> As you can see above, the endpoint - like most of Matrix - doesn't use a file type extension.
> It turns out that Synapse **really** wants that piece of JSON to served with the JSON mime type, but GitLab pages' does not support setting the mime type manually and can only derive it automatically using some heuristic.
> Thanks to the manical investigation into that heuristic, Nico came up with the idea to use GitLab's [_redirects](https://gitlab.com/matrix-meetup/matrixmeetup.de/-/merge_requests/7) or more precisely rewrite function to forward from the Matrix endpoint to the actual file served with the .json extension and what can I say - it works as proven by this screenshot from Nheko (it's Other Clients October soon, so try using Nheko)!
