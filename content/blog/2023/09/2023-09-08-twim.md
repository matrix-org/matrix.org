## Dept of Spec 📜

[Andrew Morgan (anoa)](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io) announces

> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <https://spec.matrix.org/proposals>.
>
>
> ### MSC Status
>
> **New MSCs:**
>
> * [MSC4053: Extensible Events - Mentions mixin](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4053)
> * [MSC4052: Hiding read receipts UI in certain rooms](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4052)
> * [[WIP] MSC4051: Using the create event as the room ID](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4051)
> * [MSC4050: MXID verification](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4050)
>
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
>
> * *No MSCs are in FCP.*
>
> **Accepted MSCs:**
>
> * [MSC4026: Allow `/versions` to optionally accept authentication](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4026)
>
> **Closed MSCs:**
>
> * *No MSCs were closed/rejected this week.*
>
> ### Spec Updates
>
> IETF continues to tick along with Travis and Matthew continuing to work on the transport and signalling side of things (how messages are shipped around, and how rooms are controlled), while yours truly is focusing on the content format (what is sent inside the encrypted envelope). The MIMI working group continues to hold interim meetings between IETF events in order to speed up the process leading up to the Digital Markets Act deadlines.
>
> ### Random MSC of the Week
>
> The random MSC of the week is... [MSC3767: Time based notification filtering](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3767)!
>
> This MSC introduces a new push rule condition, `time_and_day`, to allow people to control whether they should receive notifications based on their local time. This would allow for "do not disturb"-like functionality at the server level - thus extending to all clients.
>
> Of course the same can be achieved today by manually changing your push rules at different times of the day to disable all notifications - but having the logic directly in the push rules is an elegant solution.
>
> I do imagine that getting the time zones correct will be a right pain.

## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Telodendria ([website](https://telodendria.io))

An open source Matrix homeserver implementation written from scratch in ANSI C and designed to be lightweight and simple, yet functional

[Jordan Bancino](https://matrix.to/#/@jordan:bancino.net) announces

> I'm pleased to announced some much-needed changes around our project management and development process that should make it much easier for new contributors to get involved. The most major change is that all development now happens in Git (no more CVS!) on our new [Gitea instance](https://git.telodendria.io). Registration is open, and everyone is encouraged to create an account and contribute. I'm currently working on updating all the documentation, and will eventually want to re-work the website as well. Right now everything is kind of a mess as we get everything fully migrated, but stay tuned! Join [#telodendria-newsletter:bancino.net](https://matrix.to/#/#telodendria-newsletter:bancino.net) for a more complete list of changes that are planned for Telodendria, as well as to receive future updates.
>
> **We want your help!** I'm specifically making infrastructure changes for the purpose of making Telodendria friendlier to new developers and other contributors. This project is still in the very early stages; as such, we need help in pretty much every area, including paying infrastructure and development costs, building a new website, writing documentation, and developing the actual server code. If you want to be involved in building the lightest and most-portable Matrix homeserver&mdash;no matter what your skill set&mdash;I'm sure we can find a place for you. Feel free to join our room at [#telodendria-general:bancino.net](https://matrix.to/#/#telodendria-general:bancino.net) or contact me directly at @jordan:bancino.net if you have any questions about what we're doing, how we're doing it, or how you can be a part of it.

### Synapse ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/))

### Element Web/Desktop ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-web))

Secure and independent communication, connected via Matrix. Come talk with us in [#element-web:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#element-web:matrix.org)!

[Johannes Marbach](https://matrix.to/#/@johannesm:element.io) reports

> * We’ve continued extending our notification test suite. Several new tests are done and running locally but we’re, sadly, blocked on landing them because of issues with our CI.
> * We’re still hoping to unlabs the room header redesign soon but have to take a step back to first fix a few unexpected regressions caused by the work.
> * Our quest to transition from Weblate to Localazy continues. All strings in element-web and element-desktop have been re-keyed and migrated. We’ll continue doing the same for the React SDK where the bulk of our strings are.
