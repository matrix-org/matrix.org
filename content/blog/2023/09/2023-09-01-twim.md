## Dept of *Status of Matrix* 🌡️

[Thib](https://matrix.to/#/@thib:ergaster.org) says

> We’d like to thank everyone for their patience as we continue to work toward restoring the Libera.Chat bridge, and apologize for the continued inconvenience. We’ve heard from many people and communities who are impacted, who have confirmed that operating this bridge is an important service and we remain committed to getting it back online.
>
> It’s been a month since [our last update](https://matrix.org/blog/2023/08/libera-bridge-disabled/) and folks have been reaching out, so we wanted to take this opportunity to provide a brief update.
>
> The bridge team at Element is still actively working on the issues that led to the bridge being disabled in the first place. You can see some of the work that’s in flight through GitHub PRs: [#1757](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/pull/1757), [#1766](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/pull/1766), [#1764](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/pull/1764), [#1734](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/pull/1734).
>
> We’re also looking into a way to transition responsibility for the bridge from Element to being directly run by The Matrix.org Foundation over the coming months - more details as we have them.
>
> Unfortunately, we do not yet have a clear timeline for bringing the bridge back online. We’ll continue providing regular updates and will share more information as soon as we can. Thank you again for your patience! Please do not hesitate to reach out at [#libera-matrix:libera.chat](https://matrix.to/#/#libera-matrix:libera.chat) if you have any questions or concerns.

## Dept of Spec 📜

[Andrew Morgan (anoa)](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io) announces

> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <https://spec.matrix.org/proposals>.
>
> ## MSC Status
>
> **New MSCs:**
>
> * *There were no new MSCs this week.*
>
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
>
> * [MSC4026: Allow `/versions` to optionally accept authentication](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4026) (merge)
>
> **Accepted MSCs:**
>
> * *No MSCs were accepted this week.*
>
> **Closed MSCs:**
>
> * *No MSCs were closed/rejected this week.*
>
> ## New MSCs in detail
>
> In this new segment, we aim to give a bit more context as to why an MSC was opened, beyond what is available in the MSC's introduction.
>
> For [MSC4026](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4026), the primary motivation came out of the Element Backend team's desire to selectively enable new and experimental Matrix features for only a subset of users on matrix.org. Experimental features are exciting, but also have the chance to break clients completely. By only enabling a feature for a small subset of users, system administrators can ensure that there is no breakage before widening the set of users.
>
> By adding optional authentication to the [/versions](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.8/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientversions) client endpoint, which has a set of `unstable_features` flags, the homeserver is able to know which user the request came from. From there, it can decide whether a certain feature should be advertised as enabled or disabled.
>
> The expected outcome of this is safer deployments - and ultimately less panicking when (not if) something breaks.
>
> ## Spec Updates
>
> Matrix v1.8 was [released last week](https://matrix.org/blog/2023/08/23/matrix-v1.8-release/), and hot on the heels we're now working towards Matrix v1.9, due November 2023.
>
> See the "Upcoming in Matrix 1.9" section of the linked blogpost for the MSCs that the Spec Core Team plan to land in time for v1.9!
>
> ## Random MSC of the Week
>
> The random MSC of the week is... [MSC3160: Message timezone markup](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3160)!
>
> This MSC proposes new HTML syntax for formatted `m.room.message`s with a `<time>` tag that could display a time  automatically based on the receiving user's timezone/12 or 24hr/etc. preferences. This saves users from manually calculating timezone offsets in their head.
>
> I think this would be an excellent feature, and I've seen it in use already in platforms like Discord. Discord lacks any UI for the user to construct these though, instead hoping users just magically figure it out. This leads to sites like <https://hammertime.cyou/> existing. But it would be nice to see clients providing a similar native UI.
>
> What do you think? Have thoughts? Leave them [on the MSC](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3160) as a new pull request comment!

## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Synapse ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/))

Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team

[dmr](https://matrix.to/#/@dmrobertson:matrix.org) says

> This week we released [Synapse 1.91](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.91.0), which contains
>
> * [admin API](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html) improvements for [locking users](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/15870), and [filtering admins in user searches](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/16114);
> * performance improvements [for state resolution in old rooms](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/16116) and [during high replication traffic](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/16148); plus
> * [improvements](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/16030) [to the](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/16094) single-sign-on configuration
>
> We are aware of a [performance regression](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/16190) in this release which gradually consumes more CPU over time. We have just (within the last hour) begun to understand this and [have a fix planned](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/16220). We'll need to test this properly at the start of next week; you can expect a bugfix release shortly after, if all goes well.
>
> [The full changelog](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.91.0) is available on GitHub.
> Thank you to our contributors for this release: Alexander Fechler, Gabriel Rodríguez, Nick Mills-Barret, Nico, Matthew Ma, Maximilian Bosch and Theodore Ni.
>
> Aside from the release, this week we have been working on a [few](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/16212) [small](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/16210) [bugfixes](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/16211), which should make a nice addition to the upcoming 1.92 release.
>
> In other news, for the last few releases Erik has been working to fix database corruption problems relating to room retention and purging historical events. He put out a [call for testing in the Synapse Announcements room](https://matrix.to/#/!iyIlInqJyxXrRmRHFx:matrix.org/$juH3dLuZjUXXocyrhvdBcAwsEui2JnT4cczt5Z3ybEo?via=matrix.org&via=tchncs.de&via=envs.net) last Friday. It is not risk-free, but if anyone is feeling bold and is prepared to handle potential data loss, we would appreciate testing and feedback.
>
> Finally, let me once thank our community of server operators in the [#synapse:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#synapse:matrix.org) room. It is an invaluable asset; we are indebted to everyone for all of your efforts and are extremely grateful.

## Dept of Clients 📱

[Benedict](https://matrix.to/#/@benedict:imbitbu.de) says

> Just wanted to mention, that Konstantin Tskhovrebov created a really cool little Matrix messenger based on [Trixnity](https://gitlab.com/trixnity/trixnity). It is called [smalk](https://gitlab.com/terrakok/smalk), uses [Compose Multiplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-multiplatform/) and already works on Desktop, Android and iOS with the same code base. Maybe web is coming soon too.

## Dept of Services 🚀

### matrix-docker-ansible-deploy ([website](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy))

Matrix server setup using Ansible and Docker

[Slavi](https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com) announces

> Thanks to [Aine](https://gitlab.com/etke.cc) of [etke.cc](https://etke.cc/), [matrix-docker-ansible-deploy](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy) can now set up the [SchildiChat](https://github.com/SchildiChat/schildichat-desktop) client.
>
> See our [Configuring SchildiChat](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/docs/configuring-playbook-client-schildichat.md) documentation to get started.

## Dept of Bots 🤖

### Maubot-meetings

[Gwmngilfen](https://matrix.to/#/@gwmngilfen:matrix.org) announces

> Historically, Ansible has relied on an old IRC bot called Zodbot to run our official chat meetings - take notes, log action items, and so forth, as well as posting the logs to a webhost for people to read later. With the IRC bridge currently down, we decided to dust off a 2-year-old action item to write a Matrix Meeting bot. Since (a) Zodbot is written in Python, and (b) I was already using Maubot for other things, it made sense to write it in the Maubot framework.
>
> If you also have a need to a meeting Matrix, you might have a use for this! If so, you can check out the extremely hacky code [on GitHub](https://github.com/GregSutcliffe/maubot-meetings/) and deploy it to your own Maubot host in the usual way. By default the bot will post the meeting logs to the room when `#endmeeting` is called, but optionally (because this is useful to me) you can also post the logs to a Discourse instance instead. More backends for log handling are also planned.
>
> Comments/feature requests/bug reports are of course very welcome!
