## Dept of *Status of Matrix* 🌡️

[Thib](https://matrix.to/#/@thib:ergaster.org) announces

> Let me start right away with no less than a sneak peek at [Matrix 2.0](https://matrix.org/blog/2023/09/matrix-2-0/). Matthew walks us through the most exciting MSCs currently in flight with working implementations, that will be drastically changing the experience on Matrix.
> 
> One of those MSCs makes Matrix support OIDC. But Synapse already supports OIDC, right? If you want to learn more about the difference between OIDC and OIDC (sic) and how it's going to impact you, [the auth team and I wrote a post for you](https://matrix.org/blog/2023/09/better-auth/).

[Johannes Marbach](https://matrix.to/#/@johannesm:element.io) announces

> * Progress on extending our test suite for stuck notifications has carried on. We’re now at about 100 of 150 test cases being implemented. We’ve already identified multiple failures and are considering patching them up before completing the full suite.
> * You may have spotted one or the other visual regression that made it into the wild as part of our Compound adoption. Thanks to everyone who reported issues and many apologies for the inconvenience. We’re in the process of fixing the fallout. Afterwards we’ll continue finishing up the UI refresh of the room header and details.
> * Our strings are still being moved to the new Localazy instance but we’re past the midpoint now fortunately.

## Department of Community Initiatives 👪️

For everything impulsed by the community that is not an Foundation initiative.

### Matrix Community Forum

[MTRNord](https://matrix.to/#/@mtrnord:midnightthoughts.space) announces

> After some talks with some community people at summit I decided it may or may not (I am not sure, it depends on people using it!) make sense to extend the d4all forum to matrix in general :)
> 
> So tldr: <https://forum.miki.community/categories> can be used as a general Matrix place. 
> 
> Obviously, please respect the official existing channels. Not all devs will be on the Forum. Please respect that. I am not trying to kill the existing places, but I am hoping to bring a less technical place for information that's able to last and be more easily searchable by non matrix users. Since I am not sure who wants to use it and who doesn't I didn't yet create categories. If there are projects interested in a category, feel free to open a topic in general with the "new-category" tag, or just ping me. :) 
> 
> Any feedback is appreciated. This is somewhat of an experiment and is very much inspired by <https://forum.ansible.com> (Also thanks to Gwmngilfen for talking about it with me!)
