## Dept of *Status of Matrix* 🌡️

[Thib](https://matrix.to/#/@thib:ergaster.org) says

> Not only have we [formally launched the Matrix.org Foundation membership programme](https://matrix.org/blog/2023/06/membership-program/)… we're happy to already welcome our first member: Beeper!
>
> Wondering why it makes sense for Beeper to support the Foundation? In short: [we're mission-aligned, and it's a strategic business choice](https://matrix.org/blog/2023/06/beeper-joins-the-foundation/).
>
> Thanks again to Beeper for all their contributions to the Matrix ecosystem, and we can't wait for more prospective members to show that they really mean to stand for open, decentralised secure communications 🚀

## Dept of Spec 📜

[TravisR](https://matrix.to/#/@travis:t2l.io) says

> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <https://spec.matrix.org/proposals>.
>
>
> ## MSC status
>
> **New MSCs:**
>
> * [MSC4031: Pre-generating invites and room invite codes](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4031)
>
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
>
> * [MSC3820: Room version 11](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3820) (merge)
>
> **Accepted MSCs:**
>
> * [MSC4009: Expanding the Matrix ID grammar to enable E.164 IDs](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4009)
> * [MSC3989: Redact `origin` property on events](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3989)
> * [MSC3821: Update the redaction rules, again](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3821)

>
> **Closed MSCs:**
>
> * *No MSCs were closed/rejected this week.*
>
> ## Spec updates
>
> The SCT has largely been business as usual for the last week: progress is being made on the [MSCs we know about](https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/88/views/1), things are entering/completing FCP, etc. There has been some activity around [MSC3820: Room Version 11](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3820) though, largely to ensure Linearized Matrix has a clean place to start building its own room version. It's also been about a year since [Room Version 10](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.7/rooms/v10/) was cut, making it a good time to push some cleanup work out into the world.
>
> If you'd like to test room version 11, update your Synapse and join [#v11-opt2:t2l.io](https://matrix.to/#/#v11-opt2:t2l.io). It should look largely the same as any other room, but has changes that client developers should note around redactions.
>
> For Linearized Matrix news, there's effort going into specifying the complete semantics and behaviour of Matrix's transport. The in-progress draft can be read [here](https://turt2live.github.io/ietf-mimi-linearized-matrix/draft-ralston-mimi-linearized-matrix.html) and should be published as an `02` in the coming days. `03` is expected to contain specific details around the MLS constraints. For clarity: the draft is an IETF Internet-Draft (I-D), aimed at a different audience than MSCs normally would. While the I-D makes little mention of it, existing Matrix servers participating in rooms with Linearized Matrix servers will continue to be full mesh, though Linearized Matrix servers will rely on a hub to send their events. DAG servers are *not* to rely on a hub.
>
> ## Random MSC of the week
>
> This week's random MSC is [MSC3160: Message timezone markup](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3160)! If you've ever tried to say "does 15:00 CET/13:00 UTC/09:00 EST/06:00 PST work for you?", this is the MSC that fixes that problem.

## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Synapse ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/))

Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team

[Shay](https://matrix.to/#/@shayshay:matrix.org) says

> This week we released 1.86.0. Here are a few of the highlights:
>
> * Fix an error when having workers of different versions running.
> * Experimental [MSC3861](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3861) support: delegate auth to an OIDC provider
> * Correctly clear caches when we delete a room
> * Expose a metric reporting the database background update status.
>
> and much more. If you'd like to take a deep dive into the changes, you can find the release notes [here](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.86.0) and as always, if you encounter a bug feel free to report it at <https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/new/choose>.

### Element X Android ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-android))

Android Matrix messenger application using the Matrix Rust Sdk and Jetpack Compose

[benoit](https://matrix.to/#/@benoit.marty:matrix.org) says

[Danielle](https://matrix.to/#/@daniellekirkwood:one.ems.host) reports

> * The web team is still hard at work uncovering and fixing bugs relating to stuck notifications.
>     * Along with fixing bugs we’re also about to start testing our updates to the notification settings pages and expect these to be in labs in the next release
> * Our team is also making progress against our accessibility goals. Our current focus is improving the colour contrast throughout the app by updating our colour palette.
> * Along with the above we’re also working on integrating the new OIDC pieces as this new auth system will bring many improvements.

## Dept of Events and Talks 🗣️

### Matrix Salon podcast

[Christian Paul (jaller94)](https://matrix.to/#/@jaller94:matrix.org) announces

> New German episode:
> Meet Simon Dürsch, who is a founder of <https://clup.life> and passionate about collaboration within associations, clubs and similar communities. Out of his own needs to bring together people on different chat platforms, he's built a service to create bridged community rooms.
>
> As an active follower of Matrix news, chat bridging (e.g. from and to WhatsApp) is probably no news to you, however, the interview shows that Matrix still has a lot of untapped potential to enable communication of currently fragmented communities.
>

> There is great interest in Matrix in Germany and this year in particular one of FrOSCon's focus aspects is "Open Source in public administration" which seems a great fit with Matrix as well.
> Plus, of course it's always fun to meet the community!
> A small team of volunteers from the community has gotten together to organize both a **Devroom** and a **Booth/Stand**. Please find last week's announcement for more detail.
>
> ### We need your help
