## Dept of Spec 📜

[Andrew Morgan (anoa)](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io) reports

> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <https://spec.matrix.org/proposals>.
>
> ## MSC Status
>
> **New MSCs:**
>
> * [MSC4025: Local user erasure requests](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4025)
> * [MSC4023: Thread ID for 2nd order-relation](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4023)
> * [MSC4021: Archive client controls](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4021)
>
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
>
> * _No MSCs are in FCP._
>
> **Accepted MSCs:**
>
> * _No MSCs were accepted this week._
>
> **Closed MSCs:**
>
> * [MSC3523: Timeboxed/ranged relations endpoint](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3523)
>
> ## Spec Updates
>
> Part of the SCT's goals with Matrix 1.8 is to pre-plan the majority of our review attention, which means we need to be told what folks are working on to plan accordingly. We'll still have some room for random/surprise MSC work, but this is expected to be harder to acquire going forward (and so should not be relied upon).
>
> Please let us know if you're working on something which affects the spec! We want to hear about:
>
> * things that aren't MSCs (yet)
> * things that are MSCs but aren't planned to be merged in 1.8
> * MSCs which are expected to be ready in time for Matrix 1.8 (in ~2 months)
>
> If you aren't sure if your project affects the spec, talk to us about it. We do not want to be the bottleneck in your development cycle, instead preferring to know ahead of time that something will need attention from us.
>
> All we need is for you to mention your project/MSC and timeline in the [#sct-office:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org) - DMs and private rooms with SCT members are not enough to get something on the roadmap. This is to ensure there is full transparency in why the SCT is looking at something, and to ensure that the MSC moves through the process in an efficient manner. If your project has a sensitive context (commercial or otherwise), then we ask that you reference that here and someone from the team will contact you to get more information, relaying as much (non-sensitive) detail as possible back to the room here.
>
> Our expected outcome for this system is to not only be a more effective team, but also to give you a faster/more reasonable turnaround on MSC review (at all stages), more rapid deployment of stable features (dropping unstable prefixes), and overall fewer review iterations as the SCT can think about problems ahead of you actually needing a review. We seriously do not want to be a blocker, but we need to know what we could end up blocking by accident.
>
> Starting approximately August 1st, we will be starting to plan out what Matrix 1.9's release cycle will look like. A similar call to action will be raised at that point. Note that Matrix 1.8 is set to be released in late August, meaning we're aiming to have Matrix 1.9 thought out before Matrix 1.8 is released, which is a deliberately accelerated timeline than the current Matrix 1.8 release cycle planning.
>
> As always, if you have any questions about this, please let us know in [#sct-office:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org).
>
> ## Random MSC of the Week
>
> The random MSC of the week is... [MSC3869: Read event relations with the Widget API](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3869)!
>
> This MSC would allow Matrix Widgets, knowing an event ID, to request any and all other events that relate to it. Thus, if you had a `m.room.message` event, you could ask the client whether any edits have been made to that event, via asking for `m.room.message` events with `m.replace` relations.
>
> This would be useful for Widgets to traverse any data structure that used relations to tie together events - which could model all sorts of use cases!
>
> As always, leave your feedback on the MSC if this is something you're interested in or want to push forwards :)

## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Synapse ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/))

Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team

[Shay](https://matrix.to/#/@shayshay:matrix.org) reports

> It's Friday which means it's time for another TWIM. This week the backend team released Synapse v1.85.0rc2. Notable highlights include:
>
> * Fix a performance issue introduced in Synapse v1.83.0 which meant that purging rooms was very slow and database-intensive
> * Improve performance of backfill requests by performing backfill of previously failed requests in the background.
> * Fix a long-standing bug where setting the read marker could fail when using message retention
> * Fix a long-standing bug where deactivated users were still able to login using the custom `org.matrix.login.jwt` login type (if enabled)
>
> And so much more! To read about everything in the release, take a look at the release notes [here](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases) and otherwise have a great week.

### FluffyChat ([website](https://fluffychat.im))

[Krille-chan](https://matrix.to/#/@krille:janian.de) reports

> In FluffyChat we are still working on finishing the new release and polish the new html message rendering. We are nearly done and are also fixing our CI configuration so that all platforms receive the release without further problems (hopefully :D). Beside of that there is a nice merge request from @theonewiththebraid for animated emojis. For more information click here: <https://gitlab.com/famedly/fluffychat/-/merge_requests/1124> (also contains a video) I really like it but before merging I would like to find a way how we can reduce the app size first.

> Stay tuned <3

> * We started putting together a [plan](https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/25486) for integrating Compound, our new design system, into Element Web. Watch this space for more updates in the near future.
