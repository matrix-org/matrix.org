We're proud to announce [Beeper](https://beeper.com) is the first member to join
the Foundation! Beeper is a universal chat app, built on top of Matrix. Beeper
is strongly committing to support Matrix by becoming the first member in the
Gold tier as well.


## Matrix is a strategic choice

Beeper allows you to connect accounts from up to 15 different chat platforms to
get a unified inbox in a single app. The core business of Beeper is to provide a
polished app and service to their users. Beeper is built upon Matrix: behind the
scenes, a Beeper account is a Matrix account on the Beeper homeserver, and the
company hosts bridges for its users. The experience is completely transparent
for them.

Matrix was an obvious choice in Beeper's stack because of its interoperable
nature. [Bridges](https://matrix.org/ecosystem/bridges/) are the core of
Beeper's business: they are the most active bridges maintainer of the Matrix
ecosystem, and most of them are open source too. It makes a lot of sense for
Beeper to build on top of Matrix so they don't have to reinvent the wheel:
homeservers exist, the AppService API that allows them to create bridges exists,
and maintaining an in-house solution for this all would cost more than their
contribution to Matrix.

Matrix also solves the difficult problem of End-to-Bridge Encryption: it allows
bridges to decrypt messages from a third party platform like WhatsApp and
re-encrypt it for Matrix users. This makes the homeserver completely oblivious
to the content of the messages. It protects customers against passive leaks, and
the most privacy conscious ones can even [self-host their bridges](https://github.com/beeper/bridge-manager)
to get total control of the messages making it through.


## Mission aligned

Beyond the obvious business choice of relying on Matrix, Beeper and the
Foundation have a lot of values in common. The Foundation is fighting for
interoperability possible at a technical levelâ€¦ but it's also fighting to make
it possible at a legal and systemic level. We've been very vocal in the Digital
Markets Act discussions In Europe. Beeper's CEO Eric Migicovsky also took part
in the consultation launched by the EU in the hopes of opening up the walled
gardens of [Gatekeepers](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en#who-are-the-gatekeepers).
The regulation change brought by the DMA will accelerate the adoption of
interoperability across the board, bringing the tools to make it sustainable and
reliable, which is a direct business enabler for Beeper.


## Join us

We once again welcome Beeper and congratulate them for being the first member to
support the stack they rely on! As for organisations who depend on Matrix: we
still need your support to make Matrix sustainable.
