## Dept of *Status of Matrix* 🌡️

[Dandellion](https://matrix.to/#/@dandellion:dodsorf.as) announces

> Back in July I started a discussion on wikidata for adding a matrix space property, after much discussion in the wikidata community (lead mostly by tgr) we instead landed on a [Matrix room property](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P11478). This now enables slightly more accurate semantics when describing matrix rooms belonging to organizations, projects, and people on wikidata.
>
> Wikidata is a knowledge base available under a free license and using standard machine-parsable data to add information to what is known as the "semantic web", this allows querying for information like for example: [Organizations with matrix rooms](https://query.wikidata.org/#%23%20Organizations%20with%20matrix%20rooms%0ASELECT%20DISTINCT%20%3Forg%20%3ForgLabel%20%3Froom%20%3FtypeLabel%0AWHERE%20%0A%7B%0A%20%20%3Forg%20wdt%3AP31%2Fwdt%3AP279%2a%20wd%3AQ43229.%20%23%20Find%20items%20which%20are%20some%20kind%20of%20organization%0A%20%20%3Forg%20p%3AP11478%20%3Fs.%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%23%20Which%20have%20some%20statement%20%3Fs%20about%20having%20a%20matrix%20room%0A%20%20%3Fs%20ps%3AP11478%20%3Froom.%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%23%20the%20statements%27s%20matrix%20room%20value%20is%20%3Froom%0A%20%20OPTIONAL%20%7B%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%23%20And%20which%20optionally%0A%20%20%20%20%3Fs%20pq%3AP31%20%3Ftype.%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%23%20is%20of%20type%20%3Ftype%0A%20%20%7D%0A%20%20SERVICE%20wikibase%3Alabel%20%7B%20bd%3AserviceParam%20wikibase%3Alanguage%20%22%5BAUTO_LANGUAGE%5D%2Cen%22.%20%7D%20%23%20Helps%20get%20the%20label%20in%20your%20language%2C%20if%20not%2C%20then%20en%20language%0A%7D%20ORDER%20BY%20%3ForgLabel)

## Dept of Spec 📜

[Andrew Morgan (anoa)](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io) announces

> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals>.
>
>
> ## MSC Status
>
> **New MSCs:**
>
> * [[WIP] MSC3956: Extensible Events - Encrypted Events](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3956)
> * [MSC3955: Extensible Events - Automated event mixin (notices)](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3955)
> * [MSC3954: Extensible Events - Text Emotes](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3954)
> * [MSC3953: Server capability DAG](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3953)
> * [MSC3952: Intentional Mentions](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3952)
>
>
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
>
> * *No MSCs are in FCP.*
>
> **Merged MSCs:**
>
> * [MSC3904: Room version 10 as the default room version](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3904)
> * [MSC3783: Fixed base64 for SAS verification](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3783)
>
> **Closed MSCs:**
>
> * [MSC3852: Expose user agent information on `Device`](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3852)
> * [MSC3517: "Mention" Pushrule](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3517)
>     * Deprecated in favour of [MSC3952: Intentional Mentions](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3952).
>
> ## Spec Updates
>
> As you can tell from the above MSC list, Extensible Events continues to charge forwards, with Travis working busily away at replicating all of the existing event functionality (plus new functionality - image albums anyone?) in a world containing Extensible Events. As always, take a look at the core MSC ([MSC1767](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1767)) for a background on what Extensible Events is, and why it's so exciting.
>
> This week has also seen [room version 10](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/rooms/v10/) become the default recommended room version in the spec! As a reminder, v10 brings the ability to have a room that's both [knockable](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#knocking-on-rooms) and [restricted](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.5/client-server-api/#restricted-rooms) at once, as well as more strictly enforces the types of power level values.
>
> Otherwise we've seen lots of movement in other areas of the spec. Expect to see some work done around push rules (which have historically been rather complicated and fiddly...) and notifications in the days to come.
>
> ## Random MSC of the Week
>
> The random MSC of the week is... [MSC3779: "Owned" State Events](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3779)!
>
> I remember this MSC fondly. It was originally born out of [MSC3489](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3489)'s need to allow any user in the room to send `m.beacon_info` state events. This can easily be achieved today by lowering the required power level of `m.beacon_info` to the default user level. However, you then run into the issue of any user being able to edit any other user's `m.beacon_info` event!
>
> Thus this MSC attempts to modify the state events permission model so that users can "own" certain state events that they send. We already somewhat have this functionality - if you put your Matrix ID as the state ID for any state event, only you or users with a power level higher than you can edit it.
>
> Sadly this little trick (which we use for `m.room.member` events) doesn't work in the case of live location sharing, as the feature demands the ability to share location from multiple devices at once. Hence, trying to send two `m.beacon_info` events with the same state key would overwrite each other.
>
> This MSC attempts to expand the functionality by modifying the definition so that a user "owns" a state event if the state key *starts* with their Matrix ID. Problem solved... for the most part!
>
> Do check out the MSC if you have some use cases in mind that would benefit from something like this.

## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Synapse ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/))

Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team

[Shay](https://matrix.to/#/@shayshay:matrix.org) says

> A new year, more improvements to Synapse! We are back at work and have released
> Synapse v1.75.0rc2, with a host of features, bugfixes and internal changes to
> make Synapse faster and more stable. Some notable changes are:
>
> * Experimental support for MSC3391 (removing account data)
> * Support RFC7636 Proof Key for Code Exchange for OAuth single sign-on
> * Fixed a bug introduced in Synapse 1.70.0 which could cause spurious UNIQUE
>    constraint failed errors in the rotate_notifs background job
> * Removed the unspecced device field from /pushrules responses
> * Declared support for Python 3.11
>
> And much more! If you'd like to learn more, head on over to <https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases> and
> take a look.

## Dept of Bridges 🌉

### matrix-hookshot ([website](https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-hookshot))

A multi purpose multi platform bridge, formerly known as matrix-github

[Half-Shot](https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk) says

> ### Hookshot 2.6.0
>
> Evenings greetings! It's been a while since we've done a Hookshot release, so this one is pretty large. We've got two major features this time around, [**Encrypted Room Support**](https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-hookshot/latest/advanced/encryption.html) and **Service Bots**. The former now allows you to invite the hookshot bot to encrypted rooms and issue commands to it as normal, it should work entirely transparently. It currently requires a homeserver with [MSC3202](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3202) support, such as Synapse. One final note is that it's extremely experimental and beta-y, so please do not run this on your production instances or it might format your cats. However, please do report all your findings to us. We love fan mail 📧
>
> Service bots is another great feature that now allows you to split hookshot into several different bots, so you can have a GitHub bot, a GitLab bot, a JIRA bot and so on. It's [extremely flexible](https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-hookshot/latest/advanced/service_bots.html), so please have a go and let us know what you think.
>
> You can find this release at <https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/releases/tag/2.6.0>, or by doing `docker pull halfshot/matrix-hookshot:2.6.0`.
>
> Finally, the highlights are:
>
> * Add support for end-to-bridge encryption via MSC3202. ([\#299](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/299))
> * Add support for additional bot users called "service bots" which handle a particular connection type, so that different services can be used through different bot users. ([\#573](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/573))
> * Add new GitHubRepo connection config setting `workflowRun.workflows` to filter run reports by workflow name. ([\#588](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/588))
>
> * Parent projects are now taken into account when calculating a user's access level to a GitLab project. ([\#539](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/539))
> * Ensure bridge treats published and drafted GitHub releases as different events. ([\#582](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/582))
> * Remove support for Pantalaimon-based encryption. ([\#299](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/299))
> * Increase maximum size of incoming webhook payload from `100kb` to `10mb`. ([\#606](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/606))

## Dept of Clients 📱

### Nheko ([website](https://nheko-reborn.github.io))

Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.

[Nico](https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev) says

> You know the custom of having a cheesy goal for the next year? Well, I had Raclette for new years, so my only goal was to have at least one Nheko release! And for that reason and to get all the planned things out of the way for this year, it is my pleasure to announce Nheko 0.11.0!
>
> It is packed with contributions and translations from way too many people for me to count on one hand! You can find it eventually in all the usual places, for example our releases list: <https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/releases/tag/v0.11.0>
>
> If you hate clicking links, here is a small spoiler of some of the ingredients (apart from the cheese):
>
> ### Highlights
>
> * Search in your timeline 🔍
>     * Works in encrypted rooms.
>     * Search is entirely local.
>     * It might be a bit slow on some systems, since it needs to paginate the room
>       to search instead of relying on the server.
> * Pushrule support! 🫸🫷
>     * Notifications should now be faster and not rely on the server.
>     * Notifications should work properly in encrypted rooms.
>     * MSC3664 is supported for pushrules for reply (needs server support).
>     * Mentions get highlighted in the timeline.
>     * Decrypting notifications can be disabled for improved privacy.
> * Threads 🧵
>     * Threads are a simple way to structure large rooms.
>     * Start a new thread from any event.
>     * Focus on a specific thread by clicking on the colored thread button next to
>       any event from this thread.
>     * Replies automatically land inside the thread.
>
> ### Features
>
> * Remember where you left off using the new unread indicator! ---
> * Navigate to space when selected in quick switcher or via link.
> * (Re-)Add an AppImage build. (Zhymabek Roman)

> * macOS: Allow quick replies from notifications.
> * Completer for /commands.
> * Allow opening room settings from room list. (LorenDB)
> * Allow setting the status message via the dbus API. (LorenDB)
>     * Check out this for one possible usecase: <https://schlomp.space/tastytea/dotfiles/src/commit/485aa7103c4f414ce0731804acf34a65a772fd28/.local/bin/mpd2nheko> (Setting your currently playing song as your status)
> * Allow swapping Enter and Shift-Enter. (LordMZTE)
> * Preliminary support for VoIP v1. (Rohit)
> * Allow applying permission changes in spaces recursively.
> * Allow modifying permissions of users not in the room.
>
> ### Improvements
>
> * Prompt before deleting the database when the error could be resolved by the user.
> * Improve logging in particular for sync or registration errors.
> * Speedup quick switcher.
> * Prune image cache in the background.
> * Store all secrets encrypted in the database (apart from the pickle).
> * Speedup fetching olm sessions from the database.
> * Increase database resiliency at the cost of a lot of performance.
> * Rename spaces to communities.
> * Handle some rate limiting better in some cases.
> * More fine grained control over logging. (Forest)

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰

### matrix-rust-sdk ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk))

Next-gen crypto-included SDK for developing Clients, Bots and Appservices; written in Rust with bindings for Node, Swift and WASM

[ben](https://matrix.to/#/@gnunicorn:matrix.org) reports

> Even though the end of the year is usually a quiet time, big steps forward have been made in the last couple of weeks on many important areas of the rust SDK.
>
> With Sliding Sync being tried out in Element-X a few more bugs and edge-case scenarios have been uncovered, where it doesn’t play well yet. For example resending the [correct extension settings on session restart](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1307) including [to-device-tokens](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1321), [invalidation indexes](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1333), or [incorrectly skipping to-device processing](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1340) and [various other smaller fixes](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1335). The latter PR also contains a first set of integration-tests running testing the SDK against synapse and the sliding-sync-proxy. We intend to expand on that and include it in the CI as soon as github actions are unblocked for it.
>
> Similar has been done on the Timeline feature, with a [better more flexible timeline pagination implementation](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1327), a new [virtual loading indicator item](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1324), [improved logging](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1344) and [date dividers and read markers](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/1287). All good stuff, making it easier to implement a useful chat UI on top of it.
>
> On async UniFFI we see the same picture: with Swift, Kotlin and Python now executing rust futures as well as handling their error results properly. And time couldn’t be any better as we can hear the creaking of the blocking-runtime we currently have under the hood in Element-X and it is starting to show the limits of what we can implement in a useful manner. We are confident we can start experimenting with it in live apps fairly soon.
