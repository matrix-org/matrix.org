## Dept of Spec 📜

[Andrew Morgan (anoa)](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io) announces

> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <https://spec.matrix.org/proposals>.
>
>
> ### MSC Status
>
> **New MSCs:**
>
> * *There were no new MSCs this week.*
>
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
>
> * *No MSCs are in FCP.*
>
> **Accepted MSCs:**
>
> * *No MSCs were accepted this week.*
>
> **Closed MSCs:**
>
> * [MSC4052: Hiding read receipts UI in certain rooms](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4052)
> * [MSC3968: Poorer features](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3968)
> * [MSC3969: Size limits](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3969)
>
> ### Spec Updates
>
> Lots of discussion surrounding [MSC2702](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/issues/2702) this week, spread across a few threads.
>
> Otherwise, the SCT are planning to add a general "MSC Checklist" to the PR template for MSC's, which contain various do's and don'ts for the contents of MSCs. Our hope is that this will eliminate a lot of repeating errors or gotchas that we find during review, as well as prevent them from slipping through unnoticed. More to follow soon!
>
> ### Random MSC of the Week
>
> The random MSC of the week is... [MSC3959: Sliding Sync Extension: Account Data](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3959)!
>
> This is an additive MSC to [MSC3575](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3575); the core Sliding Sync MSC. As the title suggests, it adds an extension to Sliding Sync which allows clients to pull down changes to both user and room Account Data.
>
> Clients can activate this extension when making a request to the sliding sync endpoint. See the [Extensions](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/blob/kegan/sync-v3/proposals/3575-sync.md#extensions) section of MSC3575 for details.

### Synapse ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/))

Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team

[dmr](https://matrix.to/#/@dmrobertson:matrix.org) says

> Last week's Synapse update was missing. In a nutshell, we released [Synapse 1.93](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.93.0), which included two low severity security fixes:
>
> * [GHSA-4f74-84v3-j9q5](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-4f74-84v3-j9q5) / [CVE-2023-41335](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-41335)
> * [GHSA-7565-cq32-vx2x](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/security/advisories/GHSA-7565-cq32-vx2x) / [CVE-2023-42453](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-42453)
>
> Please see the advisories for more details, or contact <security@matrix.org> with any questions.
>
> This week we released Synapse 1.94.0 rc1, ahead of its release proper on the coming Tuesday. It is a lighter release, but it includes: [changes to the way media is served](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/15988), which should be particularly helpful for bridged users; a few minor [performance](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.93.0) [improvements](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/16360); plus documentation and internal improvements.
>
> On develop, Patrick has been working to land further [minor](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/16438) [performance](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/16431) [improvements](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/16429) which should help to make memory consumption less spikey. Erik has begun to work [supporting more than one receipts writer worker](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/16432), which should help improve Synapse's horizontal scaling. These should both land in Synapse 1.95, expected two weeks from the coming Tuesday.
>
> Lastly, let me express our continued thanks to our contributors, users, and especially the [#synapse:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#synapse:matrix.org) support community.

[Andrew F](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewf:element.io) reports

> Last week brought a Hookshot release which wasn't posted to TWIM, so here's your post now!
>
> The release adds a fix to a **medium** [severity security issue](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/security/advisories/GHSA-fr97-pv6w-4cj6), thus upgrading to it is highly recommended. The GitHub issue page also provides a workaround for the vulnerability as an alternative to upgrading.
>
> Other than that, there are many new features since the last release posted to TWIM (4.0.0). Highlights include:
>
> * Support for Sentry tracing
> * Support for uploading bot avatar images
> * Concurrent polling of feeds (defaulting to 4 feeds at a time)
> * Bridging of GitLab comment replies as Matrix threads
>

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰

### matrix-nio

[Paarth Shah](https://matrix.to/#/@me:shahpaarth.com) says

> It's been a hot minute since the latest release back in July, but we've now just released `matrix-nio` `0.22.0`, with some exciting new features, setup for even more features, and code cleanup!
> The full changelog can be found [here](https://github.com/poljar/matrix-nio/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0220---2023-10-6), but some highlights:
>
> * Retrieval of Space hierarchies
> * Support for Token-Authenticated Registration
> * Allow the creation of custom `room_type` from the client
> * Add support for `m.reaction` events (Closes a very longstanding [missing feature](https://github.com/poljar/matrix-nio/issues/174))
> * Add a simple streamed response to download to files
> * Cleaning up various deprecations
> * Replacing ALL type comments with type hints
> * Add `ruff` for linting, mass-refactor of the whole codebase
>
> We were able to merge a lot of important PRs from the community, including several long-standing ones! It's my sincere hope that with the following release, we'll be able to have easier, native support for relationships (including threading).
> Contributions to make that happen, and much more, are always welcome!

[Emma [it/its]](https://matrix.to/#/@emma:rory.gay) announces

### Rory&::LibMatrix

> #### New features
>
> * Experimental incremental sync support (resuming sync across sessions)
>     * You are responsible for storing state yourself (the `SyncStateResolver` class is serialisable, and holds relevant information about syncing, such as the resolved state, sync configuration such as timeout and filter, and what the next batch is)
> * Sync helper is now decoupled from AuthenticatedHomeServer, this means that you have to construct it yourself rather than calling hs.SyncHelper
>     * This allows running multiple sync loops with different filters
> * Helper function to merge state lists
>     * This is used by the incremental sync helper, if 2 states match by `type` and `state_key`, it gets replaced with the new one
> * Extension function to format exceptions as matrix messages (`ex.ToMatrixMessage("Something went wrong"`)
> * SyncHelper now has a EnumerateSyncAsync function, which allows you to run the sync loop as an enumerator rather than a forever-running function:
>
> ```cs
> await foreach (var sync in _syncHelper.EnumerateSyncAsync(cancellationToken)) {
>     // Use sync response here
> }
> ```
>
> *Do note that this does not call sync callbacks!*
>
> #### Changes
>
> * Moved some event model classes around to further clarify structure
>     * Some have been renamed in order to clarify that they represent room state events
> * Moved the unused json schema validation API call to the matrix error handling middleware
> * Moved SyncHelper's sync arguments to properties instead of function arguments
>     * This allows changing eg. filter or timeout without having to implement the sync loop yourself
> * Refactored Homeserver classes in order to prevent a deadlock due to synchronously trying to call APIs, which depending on the environment succeeds, indefinitely hangs or throws an exception
> * Further clarified what functions are async
> * Extended unit tests
>     * Unit tests now clean up their state
>     * We now have 40% test coverage of the base library!
>
> ***And, as always:***
>
> * The code is available at [my git domain](https://git.rory.gay/matrix/LibMatrix.git/)
>     * If anyone wants to contribute a page to put there instead of a plain dumb git directory, please feel free to!
>     * All other contributions are more than welcome, be it documentation, code, anything!
> * Discussion, suggestions and ideas are welcome in [#libmatrix:rory.gay](https://matrix.to/#/#libmatrix:rory.gay)

### Ruma ([website](https://ruma.dev/))

A set of Rust library crates for working with the Matrix protocol. Ruma’s approach to Matrix emphasizes correctness, security, stability and performance.

[Kévin Commaille](https://matrix.to/#/@zecakeh:tedomum.net) announces

> How time flies! It has already been 8 months since our last update, which was also our last release… But it doesn't mean nothing has been going on, quite the opposite.
>
> We have just released Ruma 0.9.0, which has full support for Matrix 1.7 and 1.8, including:
>
> * Intentional mentions
> * `event_property_is` and `event_property_contains` push rule conditions along with escaped dotted-paths
> * Asynchronous media uploads
> * Improvements to VoIP signalling
> * Room version 11
>
> And these are not the only changes, here is a small selection of other improvements:
>
> * ruma-events, which was merged inside ruma-common a few versions ago, is now its own crate again
> * The methods to create messages with relations were improved and also support intentional mentions
> * New convenience methods to manipulate a push ruleset were added
> * It is now easier to check whether a user is allowed certain actions according to the current power levels of a room
> * The HTML sanitizing code that was part of ruma-events was split in its own crate, ruma-html, with new features coming soon
>
> The full set of changes can be viewed in the corresponding crates' changelog.
>
> We still have a [bunch of issues opened](https://github.com/ruma/ruma/labels/help%20wanted) and always welcome implementations for ongoing MSCs, so don't hesitate to contribute.

### synadm ([website](https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm))

Command line admin tool for Synapse (Matrix reference homeserver)

[jacksonchen666](https://matrix.to/#/@jacksonchen666:jacksonchen666.com) announces

> Hi! No releases, just a progress update.
>
> The [Rewriting the user modify command][pr] PR has made progress. Well, at least in the placeholders part. No real code has been written *yet*.
>
> [pr]:https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm/pull/126
>
> However, we are still kind of [stuck on command names][commandname]. Basically, some are a bit too long (e.g. `set-profile-picture`) and some we're not sure about (e.g. `admin-grant` and `admin-revoke`).
>
> [commandname]:https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm/pull/126#issuecomment-1742457472

### Matrix Rooms Search

[Aine](https://matrix.to/#/@aine:etke.cc) announces

> **Matrix Rooms Search Update!**
>
> We at [etke.cc](https://etke.cc) are thrilled to unveil the latest enhancements to the Matrix Rooms Search, aimed at enhancing your search engine management experience. These updates introduce a range of new features and improvements to enhance optimization and moderation and you can see them in action on [MatrixRooms.info](https://matrixrooms.info) - the MRS demo instance managed by [etke.cc](https://etke.cc)
>
> **1. Banned Room Listing by Server**
>
> We have introduced a new endpoint, `/mod/list/{server_name}`, allowing you to easily view and manage banned rooms from a specific Matrix server. This feature provides a comprehensive list of all banned rooms on the specified server, simplifying the process of identifying and handling problematic rooms.
>
> **2. Automatic Room Avatar Resizing and Conversion**
>
> The Matrix Rooms Search now includes an automatic room avatar resizing and conversion feature. The avatars of the Matrix rooms will be automatically adjusted to the 40x40px and WebP format, ensuring consistency and dramatically decreasing egress traffic.
>
> **3. Banned and Reported Room Counts**
>
> To keep you informed about the status of the matrix rooms your MRS instance indexes, we have incorporated a count of banned and reported rooms in the `/-/status` admin endpoint. This allows you to quickly get an overview of your MRS instance.
>
> **4. Prevention of Duplicate Reports**
>
> To enhance the reporting system, we've implemented a mechanism that prevents duplicate reports for the same room. This ensures that moderators can efficiently address issues without being inundated with redundant reports.
>
> **5. Automatic Forwarding of Reports**
>
> In an effort to improve transparency and communication, the Matrix Rooms Search now supports the automatic forwarding of reports for specific rooms to the administrators of the Matrix server to which the room belongs. If your Matrix server supports [MSC1929](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1929) and has email address(-es) listed, reports will be seamlessly directed to the relevant administrators.
>
> These updates are designed to enhance the functionality and usability of the Matrix Rooms Search, making it an even more valuable and safer tool for discovering interesting rooms and communities. We hope that these improvements will contribute to a better overall Matrix experience for both users and homeservers administrators.
>
> Try [MatrixRooms.info](https://matrixrooms.info), check the [source code](https://gitlab.com/etke.cc/mrs/api) and say hi in [#mrs:etke.cc](https://matrix.to/#/#mrs:etke.cc)  room
