### Weekly Spec Update

[Andrew Morgan (anoa)](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io) says

> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <https://spec.matrix.org/proposals>.
>
> #### MSC Status
>
> **New MSCs:**
>
> * [MSC4060: Accept room rules before speaking](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4060)
> * [\[WIP\] MSC4059: Mutable event content](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4059)
> * [\[WIP\] MSC4058: Additive events](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4058)
>
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
>
> * _No MSCs are in FCP._
>
> **Accepted MSCs:**
>
> * _No MSCs were accepted this week._
>
> **Closed MSCs:**
>
> * _No MSCs were closed/rejected this week._
>
> #### Spec Updates
>
> In the new MSCs section there are new flurry of MSCs from Travis.
>
> **Matrix 1.9** has also been given a scheduled release date of **November 29th, 2023**.
>
> Travis has also put out a call in the [#sct-office:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org) for folks to add/apply feedback to any MSCs related to custom emotes and stickerpacks, as that feature is due to be reviewed (and consolidated) by the Spec Core Team this week or early next week.
>
> #### Random MSC of the Week
>
> The random MSC of the week is... [MSC4034: Media limits](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4034)!
>
> This MSC facilitates a few new features related to the storage of user media on homeservers. First, it proposes additional metadata on the [`/_matrix/media/v3/config`](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.8/client-server-api/#get_matrixmediav3config) endpoint to inform clients of the total number of bytes they're allowed to store on the homeserver, as well as the maximum number of total files they're able to store.
>
> Second, a new endpoint `/_matrix/media/v3/usage` would allow users to query how much of their total number of bytes/files they're currently using.
>
> Both of these features would allow homeservers to set and communicate media usage quotas to clients, instead of simply returning an error when the user tries to upload media that would exceed it.
>
> Seems like a very sane proposal to me! If this is something that you think would be useful to the Matrix spec, please don't hesitate to weigh in with your support/feedback :)

### Call to Action for server owners

[Aine](https://matrix.to/#/@aine:etke.cc) announces

>
> Hey there, Matrix Homeserver Owners!
>
> I'm Aine from [etke.cc](https://etke.cc/), and I want to tell you about a fantastic project we're working on: [Matrix Rooms Search](https://gitlab.com/etke.cc/mrs/api). It's a search engine for Matrix Federation public rooms.
>
> Recently, we introduced [MSC1929](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1929) integration into Matrix Rooms Search. This feature automatically notifies server owners by email if a room on their server is reported for any issues. It's an important step toward enhancing safety within the Matrix Federation.
>
> However, we've noticed that the adoption of [MSC1929](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1929) across Matrix servers is relatively low, despite the fact it is going to the proposed Final Comment Period soon. This is where we need your help!
>
> On behalf of the MRS project, we're reaching out to you to add (or update, if you previously configured it) [MSC1929](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1929) support to your homeserver. Together, we can make the Matrix Federation a safer and more secure environment for everyone.
>
> So, how can you do this? It's simple! You just need to serve the `/.well-known/matrix/support` file with the following structure on your homeserver's domain. If your Matrix ID is `@you:example.com`, the file should be available at `https://example.com/.well-known/matrix/support`:
>
> ```json
> {
>   "contacts": [
>     {
>       "email_address": "your@email.here",
>       "matrix_id": "@your:mxid.here",
>       "role": "admin"
>     }
>   ]
> }
> ```
>
> If you're using [mdad](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy), there's a handy [guide](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/docs/configuring-well-known.md#optional-introduction-to-homeserver-admin-contact-and-support-page) to assist you in setting this up.
>
> By taking this step, you'll be contributing to a safer and more secure Matrix Federation. We invite you to join us in the [#mrs:etke.cc](https://matrix.to/#/#mrs:etke.cc)  room, where you can connect with others who are interested in the MRS project.
>
> Let's work together to make the Matrix Federation a better place for all of us. Your support means a lot, and it's a step in the right direction for a more secure and connected future.

### Complement ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/complement))

Matrix compliance test suite

[Kegan](https://matrix.to/#/@kegan:matrix.org) announces

> *Complement is an end-to-end testing suite for matrix homeservers. It's used by Synapse, Dendrite and Conduit to test client/federation APIs.*
>
> Complement has had some much needed improvements to the API over the past week or two. A summary of the main changes:
>
> * **Complement now runs 2x fast as before**, if you run it with `COMPLEMENT_ENABLE_DIRTY_RUNS=1`. This speedup is possible because this setting reuses containers between tests rather than creating a new clean container for each test. On Synapse's repository, this decreases CI for postgres/worker mode from 40m to 20m.
> * **Complement CS API tests can now be written out-of-repo**. Previously, you could only write Complement tests from within the Complement repository, because tests imported private packages not exposed publicly. These packages have been cleaned up and are now exposed for people to use in their own projects. This is significant because it opens up the door for homeservers to have their own homeserver-specific tests (e.g Synapse admin APIs) in their own repository, whilst reusing all of Complement's machinery. Federation tests cannot be written out-of-repo yet as the `federation` package is still private.
> * **Complement assertion APIs are cleaner**. Complement makes heavy use of test "matchers" to check that responses have the right data in the right places. These matchers are designed to be composable so you can just use what you want and nothing more. However, helper functions which use the matchers weren't particularly composable: some required `[]byte`, others `gjson.Result`, others still `http.Response`. In addition, the common `m.MatchResponse` helper function would fail the test if the matcher returned an error, making it impossible to use in cases where you want to "retry until you see X". The API has been cleaned up into two packages: `should` and `must`. The former will just return errors if the matches fail, whilst the latter will fail the test as before. This makes it easier to reuse matchers in a variety of tests.
> * **Complement handles MSCs better**. Previously, MSCs were defined as a dedicated file e.g `msc1234_test.go` with a conditional build tag at the top of the file. Tests could then opt-in to running the MSC with `go test -tags "msc1234" ./tests/...`. This wasn't ideal for a few reasons: A) conditional builds meant that by default the files were not compiled, making it easy to break tests when refactoring, B) it wasn't possible to just run the MSC tests. MSCs are now dedicated packages and run using `go test ./tests/msc1234`. This means they are always compiled (no conditional builds) and they can be run stand-alone during development by just executing tests in that directory.
>
> We hope with these changes Complement will be even easier to use and applicable to a wider set of use cases than before.

### Matrix Client Tutorial

[uhoreg](https://matrix.to/#/@hubert:uhoreg.ca) announces

> I've made a bit of progress on my [Matrix Client Tutorial](https://uhoreg.gitlab.io/matrix-tutorial/), and added some information on [how Olm and Megolm decryption fit within a client](https://uhoreg.gitlab.io/matrix-tutorial/tying_together_megolm.html).  Encryption (both Olm and Megolm) look like they will be quite complicated to explain, due to error handling and performance considerations, so I'm expecting that Olm encryption won't be written until November at the earliest, and Megolm encryption in December at the earliest.
