## Dept of Spec 📜

[Andrew Morgan (anoa)](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io) reports

> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <https://spec.matrix.org/proposals>.
>
>
> ## MSC Status
>
> **New MSCs:**
>
> * [MSC3980: Dotted Field Consistency](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3980)
> * [MSC3979: Revised feature profiles](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3979)
> * [MSC3977: Matrix as a Messaging Framework (IETF/MIMI)](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3977)
>
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
>
> * [MSC1796: improved e2e notifications](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1796) (close)
>
> **Accepted MSCs:**
>
> * *No MSCs were merged this week.*
>
> **Closed MSCs:**
>
> * [MSC3978: Deprecate room tagging](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3978)
>
> ## Spec Updates
>
> The Spec Core Team has started to publish their weekly list of MSCs to focus on reviewing in the [Office of the Spec Core Team](https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org) room. The list consists of the MSCs that are ready for immediate review, and would most help advance the Matrix protocol on any given week. This used to happen internally (they started out as weekly ping by a bot, and then slowly became curated by our resident human, Travis). But the idea to publish the list both allows people to easily follow along with what they're doing on a weekly basis (much like these posts, but in real time!), as well as helps push subsequent discussion to public channels.
>
> Otherwise, Travis continues to be hard at work integrating Matrix into the IETF process. [MSC3923](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3923) - initially published in November 2022 - was proposed for FCP this week (and has nearly passed!). Additionally, [MSC3977](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/3977) was published this week and talks about how Matrix is a great fit for the goals of the IETF's MIMI working group.
>
> This is all ahead of the [IETF 116](https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/116/) event which starts on March 26th. The Matrix.org Foundation will be attending remotely.
>
> ## Random MSC of the Week
>
> The random MSC of the week is... [MSC3735: Add device information to m.room_key.withheld message](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3735)!
>
> This MSC proposes adding a new field, `from_device`, to [`m.room_key.withheld`](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/client-server-api/#mroom_keywithheld) messages. This to-device message type is used to inform devices why a megolm session was not sent to them after they requested it.
>
> Devices can request megolm sessions from multiple devices at once, but upon receiving a `m.room_key.withheld` message from one of them is currently unable to tell *which* of the devices responded with that message.
>
> The proposed `from_device` field should not be added to `m.room_key.withheld` messages that are sent outside of key request flows.

### Synapse ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/))

Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by the matrix.org core team

[Shay](https://matrix.to/#/@shayshay:matrix.org) reports

> Friday, Friday, Friday, also known as TWIM day. We here at Synapse have another release for you: Synapse v1.79.0. As always it is packed with features and bugfixes. Some notable highlights include:
>
> * Added media information to the command line [user data export tool](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.79/usage/administration/admin_faq.html#how-can-i-export-user-data).
> * Added an [admin API](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html) to delete a [specific event report](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.6/client-server-api/#reporting-content)
> * Added support for knocking to workers
> * Fixed a bug introduced in Synapse 1.79.0rc1 where attempting to register a `on_remove_user_third_party_identifier` module API callback would be a no-op
> * Fixed a long-standing bug where a URL preview would break if the discovered oEmbed failed to download
>
> and much more. Feel free to take a deep dive in the [release notes](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.79.0) and have a happy Friday!

### Dendrite ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite))

Second generation Matrix homeserver

[Till](https://matrix.to/#/@s7evink:matrix.org) says

> This week we released [Dendrite 0.12.0](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.12.0), which marks the end of polylith/HTTP API mode.
>
> ### Features
>
> * The userapi and keyserver have been merged (no actions needed regarding the database)
> * The internal NATS JetStream server is now using logrus for logging (contributed by [dvob](https://github.com/dvob))
> * The roomserver database has been refactored to have separate interfaces when working with rooms and events. Also includes increased usage of the cache to avoid database round trips. (database is unchanged)
> * The pinecone demo now shuts down more cleanly
> * The Helm chart now has the ability to deploy a Grafana chart as well (contributed by [genofire](https://github.com/genofire))
> * Support for listening on unix sockets has been added (contributed by [cyberb](https://github.com/cyberb))
> * The internal NATS server was updated to v2.9.15
> * Initial support for `runtime/trace` has been added to further track down long-running tasks
>
> ### Fixes
>
> * The `session_id` is now correctly set when using SQLite
> * An issue where device keys could be removed if a device ID is reused has been fixed
> * A possible DoS issue related to relations has been fixed (reported by [sleroq](https://github.com/sleroq))
> * When backfilling events, errors are now ignored if we still could fetch events
>
> ### Other
>
> * **⚠️ DEPRECATION: Polylith/HTTP API mode has been removed**
> * The default endpoint to report usages stats to has been updated
>
>
> If you have a Dendrite homeserver, staying up-to-date is highly recommended so please upgrade when you can. Otherwise, if you want to play with Dendrite without having to set up your own infrastructure, the dendrite.matrix.org homeserver is open for registration (upon completion of a CAPTCHA, so you may need to register using [Element Web](https://app.element.io/)).
>
> As always, please feel free to join us in [#dendrite:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org) for related discussion.

### Construct ([website](https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct))

A performance-oriented homeserver with minimal dependencies.

[Jason Volk](https://matrix.to/#/@jevolk:matrix.org) says

> Construct is inching closer toward public-registration safety for its upcoming 1.0 release. This week I'd like to thank tiix for helping me fix a bug in the registration availability checker, and @dynfox for dropping some documentation for how to launch Construct dockers with certbot.
>
> I'd like to thank @qg:schildi.chat and @bgiovanni for helping me hunt down an elusive auth-rules divergence between Synapse and Construct. This bug affects Synapse users who have been kicked from a room before the summer of 2022 by an admin who runs Construct. After Synapse 1.62, those users are not able to rejoin that room -- ever. This was due to a bug which added unnecessary `m.room.join_rules` to the `auth_events` which is no longer accepted by Synapse after that version. This is now fixed on our end going forward, but fixing this retroactively is something I'll be working on over the weekend. I'd like to send my regards to Philantrop 🏳️‍🌈 who first brought this to my attention and is still trying to get back into [#construct:zemos.net](https://matrix.to/#/#construct:zemos.net) even at this very moment. Don't worry, we haven't forgotten you! 😁
>
> Construct has over five years of battle-tested experience federating at scale from the very first days of Matrix. If you're looking for an alternative to Synapse to run on a cheap host: less than or equal to 100% CPU usage is our guarantee or your money back. I use it every day at

[Ananace](https://matrix.to/#/@ace:kittenface.studio) says

> My [Helm Charts](https://gitlab.com/ananace/charts) continue to be updated regularly, now offering an improved first-install experience for Synapse through running the original signing key generation as an install hook. The sliding sync proxy is now also packaged as a Chart for those wanting to spin one up to test with.

[Half-Shot](https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk) says

> ### Hookshot 3.0.0 storms in and demands attention
>
> Howdy folks, another big release for you coming up. So you remember how last week Justin and Myself came onto [Matrix Live](https://youtu.be/HlsMMzTFZ_A) to talk about the new
> bridge widgets and show off how sleek and snappy they are? Well, Hookshot is **also** getting some updates of a similar flavor. The more observant of you may be starting to notice a pattern
> of us tarting up our public integrations. Something might well be on the horizon very, very soon :)
>
> In the meantime, here are the latest changes for [Hookshot 3.0.0](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/releases/tag/3.0.0):
>
> * Add support from migrating go-neb services to Hookshot ([\#647](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/647))
> * Implement grant system to internally record all approved connections in hookshot. ([\#655](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/655))
> * Add support for logging into GitHub via OAuth from bridge widgets. ([\#661](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-hookshot/issues/661))
>
> and a bunch of other changes too!
>
> You'll notice we're migrating to a grant system for approving connections, which is why this is considered a breaking major release. **Please check the
> notes before updating** and give us a quick message if you have any issues or concerns.
>
> And with that, I wish you all a great weekend!

## Dept of Clients 📱

### Chooj ([website](https://github.com/farooqkz/chooj))

[Farooq](https://matrix.to/#/@farooqkz:mozilla.org) reports

> In the [chooj](https://github.com/farooqkz/chooj) repository we haven't got any new commit. However, in [KaiUIng](https://github.com/farooqkz/KaiUIng)'s which is an important dependency of chooj(not the fattest one, however!) we had several new commits. Mainly, I am trying to use Typescript instead of Javascript for better productivity and catching bugs before production.

### Fractal ([website](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal))

Matrix messaging app for GNOME written in Rust.

[Kévin Commaille](https://matrix.to/#/@zecakeh:tedomum.net) reports

> As predicted 3 weeks ago, Fractal 4.4.2 has been released and is available on Flathub.
>
> As a reminder, there are no new features, but it makes Fractal compatible with newer versions of our dependencies. Big thanks to everyone who tested the beta version and feel free to uninstall it.
>
> In another news, let's talk a bit about Fractal 5…
>
> We have finally implemented one of the most annoying missing features: sending read receipts and updating the fully-read marker. What is doubly great about this, is that we are now only one feature away from being regression-free compared to our stable release (and a merge request is opened for the last one)!
>
> This means that a beta release is around the corner, but we also have serious performance issues to resolve first. We hope that switching to the new store backend currently developed in the Matrix Rust SDK will fix some of it, but we still need to investigate properly how we can improve the situation.
>
> That's all for this week, don't hesitate to come say hi in [#fractal:gnome.org](https://matrix.to/#/#fractal:gnome.org). If you would like to help us, take a look at our [newcomers issues](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/issues/?label_name%5B%5D=4.%20Newcomers) (and don't forget to read our `CONTRIBUTING.md` first).

## Dept of Ops 🛠

### GitHub Action ([website](https://github.com/Cadair/matrix-notify-action))

[Cadair](https://matrix.to/#/@cadair:cadair.com) says

> I have pushed a small update to my [GitHub Action](https://github.com/Cadair/matrix-notify-action) to send matrix notifications about builds. It now correctly backs off if it's rate limited by the matrix server, and has a new option to combine all successful statuses into a single reaction, which is useful if you have a lot of builds.

### matrix-docker-ansible-deploy ([website](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy))

Matrix server setup using Ansible and Docker

[Slavi](https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com) reports

> Thanks to [Aine](https://gitlab.com/etke.cc) of [etke.cc](https://etke.cc/), [matrix-docker-ansible-deploy](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy) can now set up [rust-synapse-compress-state](https://github.com/matrix-org/rust-synapse-compress-state)'s `synapse_auto_compressor` tool to run periodically.
>
> Learn more from [our changelog entry](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/cf7f9701b731640e3fde8e8d48914ecfbbf7e200/CHANGELOG.md#synapse-auto-compressor-support).

## Dept of Bots 🤖

### flip-matrix-bot ([website](https://gitlab.com/FriendlyLinuxPlayers/flip-matrix-bot))

A Matrix bot for the [Friendly Linux Players](https://friendlylinuxplayers.org/) community.

[HER0](https://matrix.to/#/@HER0:matrix.org) says

> In the past two weeks, there have been a bunch of small improvements. The [events page](https://friendlylinuxplayers.org/events) of the community website now lists upcoming events, and the event pages themselves have received some polish. As a result, links to event web pages are now included in the output of several commands. This makes it easier to see the event time in your local time and to share the event with people who are not in the Matrix room.
>
> Looking to the future, improving these web pages brings us a step closer to integrating with [Steam](https://gitlab.com/FriendlyLinuxPlayers/flip-matrix-bot/-/issues/23) and [Mastodon](https://gitlab.com/FriendlyLinuxPlayers/flip-matrix-bot/-/issues/16). I've started to investigate these further, but there isn't much to report yet.
>
> Besides website-related improvements, I took some time to add unit tests for the lowest-hanging fruit parts of the code. There are more tests to be added, and further testing improvements may be possible in the future after some refactoring, but this is not a high priority for me right now.

## Dept of Interesting Projects 🛰️

### bridged.to project idea handing over

[Alexey Murz Korepov](https://matrix.to/#/@murz:ru-matrix.org) reports

> **Searching for people to hand over a business idea of paid bridges for Matrix users to other messengers, for free!**
>
> I have a business idea to make a paid service for bridging Matrix ([matrix.org](http://matrix.org/)) with other messengers using the Bridges feature (<https://matrix.org/bridges/>). It's like [beeper.com](http://beeper.com/), but which works with any MXID on any homeserver. And like [t2bot.io](http://t2bot.io/), but commercial one and with more bridges available. Yes, t2bot.io is a great project, but free services usually got occupied by a lot of accounts, especially by spammers, and managing all of them for free sounds not so perspective to me. But [bridged.to](http://bridged.to/) could also provide some free services for the community.
>
> For that purposes I’ve bought a [bridged.to](http://bridged.to/) domain several years ago, to make cool identifiers of bridges like `@telegram:bridged.to`, `@whatsapp:bridged.to`, etc.
>
> But I still can’t find time to implement this idea at all. So, I’ve decided to stop paying for this domain and want to hand over this domain and the whole idea to someone else, who has the time and energy to implement this project.
>
> The idea was to make the payments flexible, per-bridge, for example, $1 per month for each bridge. So, if a user will use bridges to Telegram + FaceBook + Instagram + WhatsApp, they will pay $4 per month, if they stop using some bridges - they pay less. And give a free trial period of 2 weeks for new users, to give it a try.
>
> From the technical point of view, this should look like a standard Synapse server with a custom python module that just block-unblocks sending of messages by the user’s account balance, and also can gather some usage statistics (number of bridged messages per user, etc), and bridges instances, connected via appservices. And some admin panel with UI to manage and administrate this.
>
> All this sounds easy to implement, but I have a lot of tasks at my main job, so have no time to accomplish this, and have decided to hand over this idea to someone else, who might be interested in it, for free.
>
> So, if you’re interested in this idea or want to know more, or even just want to grab the cool [bridged.to](http://bridged.to/) domain for free - please feel free to contact me via Matrix - @murz:ru-matrix.org.
>
> The domain annual cost is $41.98, it's on namecheap.com, expires at Mar 28, 2023.
