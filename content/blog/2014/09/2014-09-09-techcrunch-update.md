The Matrix team is atÂ <a href="http://techcrunch.com/events/disrupt-sf-2014/">TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2014</a> this week - we had a great time at the hackathon on Saturday/Sunday where we were really excited to see several teams building their hacks on Matrix APIs - we stayed the night to support whilst building out our own hack (experimenting with sending collaborative 3D animations over Matrix as JSON)! Huge thanks to everyone who built on top of Matrix - hope you had as much fun as we did :)

Please come talk to us in person in Startup Alley (next to the Brazilian Pavilion) if you're attending Disrupt and find out all about Matrix first hand!

(Photo shows us somehow surviving in the 6am slot. Mental note to never try to do raycasting vector maths after being up for 24 hours again...)
