## Dept of *Status of Matrix* 🌡️

[Matthew](https://matrix.to/#/@matthew:matrix.org) says

> Very happy to announce that the Spec Core Team has been reviewing how to make more progress on MSCs and get more organisational diversity into the SCT, and we've decided to expand the team - unanimously voting to add both tulir and clokep to the team effective today. Huge thanks to both tulir and clokep for being up for joining and donating their time... and looking forwards to their contributions in helping get MSCs to and through their Final Comment Period and merged into the spec!

[Josh Simmons](https://matrix.to/#/@josh:josh.tel) says

> We’re excited to be forging stronger ties with other open source foundations, so that we can work together and lean on one another’s areas of expertise. Last week we announced that [the Matrix.org Foundation joined OpenForum Europe](https://openforumeurope.org/mozilla-and-the-matrix-org-foundation-join-ofe-as-supporters/) as a supporter alongside Mozilla and many others.
> 
> Adding to that, we’re pleased to share that we have become [an affiliate of the Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/affiliates/) and joined their [Open Policy Alliance](https://opensource.org/programs/open-policy-alliance/), and we’ve also [joined the Eclipse Foundation as an associate member](https://www.eclipse.org/membership/exploreMembership.php).
> 
> We look forward to going further, faster, together! 🚀

## Dept of Clients 📱

### SchildiChat ([website](https://schildi.chat))

SchildiChat is a fork of Element that focuses on UI changes such as message bubbles and a unified chat list for both direct messages and groups, which is a more familiar approach to users of other popular instant messengers.

[SpiritCroc](https://matrix.to/#/@spiritcroc:spiritcroc.de) announces

> [SchildiChat Next](https://github.com/SchildiChat/schildichat-android-next), our SchildiChat Android rewrite based on Element X, has received a couple of updates since our last report.
> 
> First, spaces support has matured.
> We now properly integrate the space filter with sliding sync, which means that when you filter for spaces, you're less likely to encounter missing room previews.
> Additionally, aggregated space unread counts and swipe gesture to switch spaces are back, and user-chosen space sort order is now respected.
> 
> Independent of spaces but also related to features that our old Android app had, you can now mark rooms as unread again, following [MSC2867](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2867).
> Similarly, incoming HTML details-tags in formatted messages as sent by some bots are now collapsed by default again, allowing you to expand them on demand by touching the message.
> 
> Since Element X has added support for UnifiedPush, we naturally have that back now too.
> However, I changed our implementation a bit to use [UnifiedPush's FOSS FCM distributor](https://github.com/UnifiedPush/android-foss_embedded_fcm_distributor), which means that ideally we can avoid having to maintain two separate app flavors for the Play Store and F-Droid releases in the future (once we do stable releases), and those who install it from F-Droid can still use FCM for push notifications if their device supports it, while not having any closed-source Google library bundled with the app.
> I'm curious how well this works, so let us know if you have any issues with FCM that you cannot reproduce on Element X!
> Custom user-installed push distributors are given precedence over FCM, of course.
> 
> On the infrastructure side, translations of our SchildiChat-specific strings added on top of Element are now open for contributions at our [weblate](https://weblate.spiritcroc.de/projects/schildichat/schildichat-android-next/).
> Thank you to everyone who has already contributed!

### Element X iOS ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios))

A total rewrite of Element-iOS using the Matrix Rust SDK underneath and targeting devices running iOS 16+.

[Ștefan](https://matrix.to/#/@stefan.ceriu:matrix.org) reports

## Dept of Non Chat Clients 🎛️

### Circles ([website](https://www.kombuchaprivacy.com/circles/))

E2E encrypted social networking built on Matrix. Safe, private sharing for your friends, family, and community.

[cvwright](https://matrix.to/#/@cvwright:futo.org) says

> This week we fixed a particularly bad bug that had appeared in recent Circles iOS beta releases, where the app would fail to resume syncing with the server under certain conditions.  We released v0.9.5 which (we think!) finally resolved the last of the sync issues.  Then we also released a further update v0.9.6 to address a corner case where users could not decrypt messages posted between the time when they were initially invited and when they finally joined the room.  With these two beta releases, we believe we have resolved all known decryption issues.  It should be smoother sailing from here!  The latest Circles iOS build is available for beta testers on Apple's [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/Hvj9S0SX).
> 
> On Android, Circles v1.0.25 is now available on [F-Droid.org](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.futo.circles/) and in beta release on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.futo.circles).
> 
> Source code for both platforms is available as always from the [FUTO Gitlab](https://gitlab.futo.org/circles) and from our [Github mirrors](https://github.com/futo-org/).

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰

### Rory&::LibMatrix (.NET 8 matrix bot/client library/SDK)

[Emma [it/its]](https://matrix.to/#/@emma:rory.gay) says

> This week has some minor changes and cleanup
> 
> ### Changes
> * `room.GetNameOrFallbackAsync()` now returns alias before building from member list
> * Cleaned up the EventTypes sub-library to consistently have EventId constants defined, for easy access
> * `room.GetManyMessagesAsync(...)` now has an optional `chunkSize` property, in order to cap the `limit=` sent on the API.
> * Applied syntax style across all of LibMatrix
> 
> _**And, as always:**_
> 
> * The code is available at [cgit.rory.gay](https://cgit.rory.gay/matrix/LibMatrix.git)!
>     - All contributions are more than welcome, be it documentation, code, anything! Perhaps, example usecases, bots, ...?
> * Discussion, suggestions and ideas are welcome in [#libmatrix:rory.gay](https://matrix.to/#/#libmatrix:rory.gay) (Space: [#mru-space:rory.gay](https://matrix.to/#/#mru-space:rory.gay))
