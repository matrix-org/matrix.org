## Matrix Live

No Matrix Live this week, but there will be plenty of Matrix talks (live!) on
Sunday at FOSDEM in the [Matrix
devroom](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/track/matrix/), and at [Matthew's
main track
talk](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-3345-opening-up-communication-silos-with-matrix-2-0-and-the-eu-digital-markets-act/).
The talks are livestreamed, so you can follow even if you aren't at FOSDEM (or
if you *are* in FOSDEM but the room is full).  If you are at FOSDEM, you can
also find live Matrix people at the matrix.org stand in Building K, level 2.

[Josh Simmons](https://matrix.to/#/@josh:josh.tel) announces

> Announced today during the EU Open Source Policy Summit in Brussels, [the Matrix.org Foundation and Mozilla have joined OpenForum Europe as supporters](https://openforumeurope.org/mozilla-and-the-matrix-org-foundation-join-ofe-as-supporters/). OpenForum Europe has proven an effective convener and advocate for open source and open standards in Europe, and we’re glad to help further that work.

[Josh Simmons](https://matrix.to/#/@josh:josh.tel) announces

> This week the Matrix.org Foundation launched a new fundraiser, shared some high level budget figures, and kicked off a series diving into our emerging roadmap!
>
> We’ve made huge strides over the last year, with the Foundation more robust and independent than ever before, and there’s a lot to be excited about in the future. Critically, we still need more organizations to step up to fund our work before January 2025.
>
> Huge thanks to Beeper, Gematik, Fractal Networks, Fairkom, Thunderbird, and the hundreds of individuals who have already stepped up! Learn more in [our blog post](https://matrix.org/blog/2024/01/2024-roadmap-and-fundraiser/) and [become a member](https://matrix.org/membership/) today 🚀

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰

### Elm SDK

[Bram](https://matrix.to/#/@bram:matrix.directory) says

> In the past week, a major refactor has been finalized that only results in a patch change given Elm's semantic versioning: the Elm types can easily be encoded and decoded, as can be found in its [documentation](https://noordstar.github.io/elm-matrix-sdk-beta/). From now on, any Elm update is reflected on its documentation: starting from [the new patch update beta 2.1.2](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/noordstar/elm-matrix-sdk-beta/2.1.2/)!
>
> I am still looking for feedback on how to design a proper immutable timeline data structure - if you have any tips, please help me out at the public [#elm-sdk:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#elm-sdk:matrix.org) room! Thanks.

### Rory&::LibMatrix (.NET 8 matrix bot/client library/SDK)

[Emma \[it/its\]](https://matrix.to/#/@emma:rory.gay) says

> Some larger changes this time around, although organisational.
>
> #### Changes
>
> * FederationClient has been split out from RemoteHomeserver (access is available through `rhs.FederationClient`, if we were able to find the s2s API)
> * Federation API resolution failure no longer causes client initialisation failure (commonly caused by CORS)
> * MessageBuilder now has more functionality (eg. adding a HTML tag with attributes)
> * Sync filters now get uploaded to /filters and referenced by ID, rather than only being able to pass them in the URL. This also allows uploading them yourself. Utility functions have been provided to store/request them by names, if wanted.
> * ***BIG CHANGE:*** LibMatrix is no longer a monorepo! All example bots have been split out into [separate repositories](https://cgit.rory.gay/matrix)
>
> #### New features
>
> * You can now enumerate account data
> * You can now call /capabilities
>
> **And, as always:**
>
> * The code is available at [cgit.rory.gay](https://cgit.rory.gay/matrix/LibMatrix.git)!
>     * All contributions are more than welcome, be it documentation, code, anything! Perhaps, example usecases, bots, ...?
> * Discussion, suggestions and ideas are welcome in [#libmatrix:rory.gay](https://matrix.to/#/#libmatrix:rory.gay) (Space: [#mru-space:rory.gay](https://matrix.to/#/#mru-space:rory.gay))
> * Got a cool project that you're working on and want to share, using LibMatrix? Be sure to let me know, I'd love to hear all about it!

### Matrix client tutorial

[uhoreg](https://matrix.to/#/@hubert:uhoreg.ca) says

> My [Matrix client tutorial](https://uhoreg.gitlab.io/matrix-tutorial/) has had a few new sections added to it: handling `m.room.encryption` events (and disallowing encryption from being disabled once enabled), detecting replay attacks, and discarding outbound sessions.  Next up will be writing a simple bot to demonstrate encryption, and then I'm planning on going through the encryption section again and tidying things up.
