Hey all,

We’ve just released the milestone [Matrix 1.11](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.11/) update for the protocol. It’s been almost exactly 3 months since the last release, [Matrix 1.10](https://matrix.org/blog/2024/03/22/matrix-v1.10-release/), keeping us on track for our once-a-quarter release schedule.

There are 9 MSCs released in Matrix 1.11 today, but there’s one specific MSC we’d like to draw your attention to: [MSC3916 - Authenticated Media](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3916). Until today, Matrix had a design flaw which allows a user to access media unauthenticated if they knew the URL. This has been used to share files in social media posts, link images outside of chats, and generally imply that a homeserver is a CDN for the internet. Some of these use cases are legitimate, though many are not. This is fixed with [MSC3916](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3916).

This post covers [MSC3916](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3916) and its implementation guidelines in more detail, but the full changelog for Matrix 1.11 is available at the end, as always.

## MSC3916: Authenticated Media

The Trust & Safety team has been hard at work fixing the design flaw in media mentioned above, taking [MSC3916](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3916) under their wing and bringing it to release here. The goal has been to roll out the feature as fast as possible, and that’s culminated in the following plan after consultations with us on the Spec Core Team.

Servers are encouraged to _freeze_ unauthenticated media access (i.e. only allow historical media to be accessed without auth) _before_ Matrix 1.12 is released, which we anticipate will happen in about August 2024. Any media which is cached or uploaded before that freeze will remain accessible on the unauthenticated endpoints indefinitely to avoid breaking existing links in social media, external chats, etc. Media which is cached or uploaded after the freeze takes place will only be accessible through the new authenticated endpoints - callers will receive a 404 error on the unauthenticated side.

The MSC has a bit more detail about the side effects of this approach, and more on the considerations leading to this proposed plan. Implementations might choose to support a config flag to enable/disable the freeze as needed, or simply release a version which freezes unauthenticated media on startup. Either are effective approaches for improving user safety and privacy.

Each homeserver should additionally consider its local ecosystem before freezing unauthenticated media by ensuring bridges and the popular clients among users are ready for authenticated media in particular. Ideally, users should see no visible impact to this change being rolled out. To help encourage this, the matrix.org homeserver will be rolling out authenticated media relatively quickly itself - watch for news on the blog next week for specific timelines.

Client and server developers are encouraged to support authenticated media as soon as they can to help server admins make the switch. Servers have a bit more work to do than clients, unfortunately, but both should have a reasonably easy time adding in the relevant support. The T&S team have made themselves available in [#matrix-client-developers:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-client-developers:matrix.org) and [#matrix-homeserver-developers:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-homeserver-developers:matrix.org) to help developers implement this new feature - feel free to visit the respective room for your project and ask questions.

Below is some implementation guidance for developers, though is not a replacement for the [spec](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.11/client-server-api/#content-repository). Where this post and the spec differ, please prefer the spec. :)

### Client implementation guidance

Thankfully, supporting authenticated media should be relatively trivial for most clients. When the homeserver declares support for Matrix 1.11 through <code>[/versions](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.11/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientversions)</code>, the client should use the new [<code>/_matrix/client/v1/media/*</code> endpoints](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.11/client-server-api/#content-repo-client-behaviour), noting that they now require authentication. The user’s access token can be supplied using the <code>Authorization</code> header. (Note that using the query string <code>?access_token</code> method is not recommended, and [deprecated](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.11/client-server-api/#using-access-tokens) in Matrix 1.11 for all endpoints.)

If the server _doesn’t_ support Matrix 1.11, the existing `/_matrix/media/*` endpoints should continue to be used.

This may end up looking something like the following in a client:

```js
const specVersions = doRequest('GET', '/_matrix/client/versions', accessToken);
if (specVersions.versions.includes("v1.11")) {
 return doRequest('GET', `/_matrix/client/v1/media/download/${serverName}/${mediaId}`, accessToken);
} else {
 return doRequest('GET', `/_matrix/media/v3/download/${serverName}/${mediaId}`, null);
}
```

Clients which rely on a web browser may have to use a [Service Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) to append the required header, particularly for `img` tags and similar.

Clients should additionally note that, as well as <code>[/_matrix/media/v3/download/{serverName}/{mediaId}](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.11/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv1mediadownloadservernamemediaid)</code>, the following other endpoints have moved to the <code>/_matrix/client/v1/media/*</code> namespace:

* <code>[GET /_matrix/client/v1/media/preview_url](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.11/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv1mediapreview_url)</code>
* <code>[GET /_matrix/client/v1/media/config](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.11/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv1mediaconfig)</code>
* <code>[GET /_matrix/client/v1/media/thumbnail/{serverName}/{mediaId}](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.11/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv1mediathumbnailservernamemediaid)</code>
* <code>[GET /_matrix/client/v1/media/download/{serverName}/{mediaId}/{fileName}](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.11/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv1mediadownloadservernamemediaidfilename)</code>

The media <code>[/upload](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.11/client-server-api/#post_matrixmediav3upload)</code>, <code>[/upload/{serverName}/{mediaId}](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.11/client-server-api/#put_matrixmediav3uploadservernamemediaid)</code>, and <code>[/create](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.11/client-server-api/#post_matrixmediav1create)</code> endpoints have not yet moved; they are expected to make the switch in a future spec version.

### Server implementation guidance

As mentioned above, servers are a bit more tricky. The Client-Server API endpoints are relatively straightforward: they are the exact same as the previous endpoints, just with authentication added and at a new path. The Federation API endpoints are a bit more challenging. Most server projects have already started implementation, but for those which haven’t (or need a bit of guidance), there’s some information [here](https://matrix.org/docs/spec-guides/authed-media-servers/).

Server authors are also encouraged to review the client guidance above to gain a better understanding of what their connected clients will be looking for and doing.

## Up next in Matrix 1.12 and beyond

Over the next 2-3 months, we’ll be focusing on the following MSCs:

* Early review of Matrix 2.0 features as they become ready.
    * Sliding sync - [MSC3575](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3575), or its Simplified variation, and applicable extensions.
    * Group VoIP - Exact MSCs to be determined, as they may change following implementation.
    * OIDC Authentication - primarily [MSC3861](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3861).
    * Encryption stability - primarily [MSC4153](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4153).
* Pre-implementation review of Trust & Safety MSCs as required.
    * Exact MSCs to be determined. Likely to include some “reporting v2” work.
* Extensible Events and Custom Emoji/Stickers unblocking as required and able.

Additionally, we’ll be continuing to define the expectations of a Spec Core Team member, particularly as it relates to the Governing Board of the Foundation. This exercise has been extremely valuable to us so far, and will help identify areas the Foundation and SCT may need support from each other.
