Hey all,

Welcome to the [Matrix 1.12](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.12/)! It’s been just over 3 months since
[Matrix 1.11](https://matrix.org/blog/2024/06/20/matrix-v1.11-release/) introduced authenticated media,
and today we’re bringing more Trust & Safety features to the ecosystem,
alongside the normal clarifications and general improvements to the protocol.
This release is also technically a few days late on the quarter, but it’s for good reason!
Folks from across the ecosystem got together in Berlin for the [Matrix Conference](https://conference.matrix.org/),
and after [things wrapped up](https://matrix.org/blog/2024/09/22/this-week-in-matrix-2024-09-22/#matrix-conference-2024)
we were busy following up on ideas started on site. We can’t wait to see all of these ideas materialize as MSCs,
but in the meantime, back to the honorary Q3 release of the spec:

Matrix 1.12 marks the recommended date for all servers to enable their media freeze,
similar to matrix.org’s [back in early September 2024](https://matrix.org/blog/2024/06/26/sunsetting-unauthenticated-media/).
Servers which haven’t yet enabled their media freeze are strongly encouraged to do so,
if it makes sense for their users.
Matrix 1.12 also brings some improvements and clarifications to authenticated media,
and a total of 9 MSCs covering a wide range of features.

Read on for a few highlights, and the full changelog at the end of this post.

## Account locking

Prior to Matrix 1.12, the available account states for a user were “active” and “deactivated”,
with no options for in-between or less destructive states.
[MSC3939](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3939) adds a new state,
“locked”, to the mix which preserves the user’s account,
but logs them out and doesn’t let them back in until the lock is removed.
This new state could be used to prevent an attacker from brute forcing an account,
handling out of band verification, or be a reaction to a moderation/terms of service decision.
The server admin can then later reverse the lock with no impact on the user’s rooms, messages,
or account information, unlike with deactivation.

When paired with [MSC3823](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3823)-style suspension,
server admins have more non-destructive options to stop a user’s pattern of behaviour.
They can completely kick the user out of their account with locking,
or allow them to continue using the account in “read only” mode.
[MSC3823](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3823) is pending some
implementation checks at the moment, but is expected to land in the next couple of releases.

Clients looking to implement locking or suspension will need to look at error codes, and continue calling `/sync` to
determine when the account state changes (either back to active, or deactivated).
[MSC3939](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3939) and
[MSC3823](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3823) both have suggestions
for what the UI might look like for a client as well.

## Marking rooms as unread

Finally, it’s possible to mark a room as “unread” after reading it.
The existing read receipts structure makes this a uniquely difficult task to do traditionally,
but [MSC2867](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2867) found a way
to get the same effect using account data instead. This approach doesn’t always maintain the unread message count,
if it can even be calculated, but does offer users an ability to mark a room as something to come back to.

Client implementation can be a bit tricky when interacting with the overall notification system,
but some may find it easy to add support for. In future it may be possible to mark individual messages as unread,
or have the server calculate unread-ness over
[Simplified Sliding Sync](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4186), for example.

## Up next in Matrix 1.13 and beyond

Matrix 1.13 is expected to be released between late November and early December 2024.
Many of the Matrix 2.0 features are undergoing finishing touches, particularly on the MSC side,
and may also be ready for inclusion in the spec release. Meanwhile,
we’re keeping an eye on
[MSCs proposed for Final Comment Period](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aprlabel%3Aproposed-final-comment-period),
and taking suggestions for MSCs which may be ready for the next stage in the process:
if there’s something you think is ready for FCP, let us know in the [SCT Office room](https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org)!
