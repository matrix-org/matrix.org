### The weekly spec update

[Andrew Morgan (anoa) {he/him}](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io) announces

> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by
> Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <https://spec.matrix.org/proposals>.
>
> #### MSC Status
>
> **New MSCs:**
>
> * [MSC4210: Remove legacy mentions](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4210)
> * [MSC4209: Updating endpoints in-place](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4209)
> * [MSC4208: Adding User-Defined Custom Fields to User Global Profiles](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4208)
> * [MSC4207: Media identifier moderation policy](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4207)
> * [MSC4206: Moderation policy auditing and context](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4206)
> * [MSC4205: Hashed moderation policy entities](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4205)
> * [MSC4204: `m.takedown` moderation policy recommendation](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4204)
> * [MSC4203: Sending to-device events to appservices](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4203)
> * [MSC4202: Reporting User Profiles](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4202)
> * [MSC4201: Profiles as Rooms v2](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4201)
> * [MSC4198: Usage of OIDC login_hint](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4198)
> * [MSC4197: Copy Paste Hints](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4197)
>
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
>
> * [MSC4170: 403 error responses for profile APIs](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4170) (merge)
>
> **Accepted MSCs:**
>
> * [MSC4189: Allowing guests to access uploaded media](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4189)
>
> **Closed MSCs:**
>
> * *No MSCs were closed/rejected this week.*
>
> #### Spec Update
>
> Lots of interesting MSCs came in this week! Note that last week's are also listed as the spec update was skipped.
>
> A swath are looking to improve moderation in Matrix, while others aiming to improve the story around notifications and
> end-to-end encrypted bridges.
> There's also been lots of discussion on the hot [MSC4133: Extending User Profile API with Key:Value pairs](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4133),
> which can be built upon with spec'd profile fields such as `m.timezone` ([MSC4175](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4175)).
>
> [MSC4208](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4208)
> is the result of splitting out the custom fields portion of that MSC,
> as it was determined that that portion of MSC4133 needed further discussion before merging.
>
> Finally, [MSC4189: Allowing guests to access uploaded media](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4189)
> being merged closes one of the final gaps with the authenticated media epic.

### Element-Web

[tulir](https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net) announces

> My PR for rendering media captions was just merged into element web :3 <https://github.com/element-hq/matrix-react-sdk/pull/43>
>
> This allows for a caption to be shown next to the media filename by adding support for the changes from [MSC2530](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2530)

### Extera Material Design

[OfficialDakari](https://matrix.to/#/@officialdakari:extera.xyz) says

> * Speed dial button
> * Profile edit window
> * Room and space settings
> * floating buttons in room timeline
>
> Also I've brought back sound effects and Project Sekai related auth background.
> They are now stored locally (P.S.: Hardcoding Matrix Media URLs was the worst idea)

### Rory&::MatrixUtils - General utility suite for Matrix

[Emma [it/its]](https://matrix.to/#/@emma:rory.gay) reports

> Tiny updates this week :)
>
> A short list of major changes:
>
> * You can now add sessions with an access token, this opens up usage of
>   RMU to users of homeservers without password login. No more messing with localstorage!
> * Fixed a bug with the policy list editor, that caused state keys to be double URL-encoded.
>   You can now successfully edit and remove policies again!
>
> The "first party" instance is available at <https://mru.rory.gay>, and is a clientside-only web app!
> If RMU has provided value in your daily routines or as a one time thing, please do consider donating over at [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/RorySys)!
>
> ***And, as with all of the other projects:***
>
> * The code is available at [cgit.rory.gay](https://cgit.rory.gay/matrix/tools/MatrixUtils.git/)!
>     * All contributions are more than welcome, be it documentation, code, layout/UI/UX improvements, anything!

>
> #### Changes
>
> * Bots can now load their access tokens from a file! You're welcome, systemd users! 🔒
> * Fixed and improved interoperation with tools like Draupnir. (Breaking: don't URL encode your state keys anymore!)
> * Minor work towards packaging & potentially publishing to NuGet! Maybe LibMatrix in your local package repo soon? 🦊 👉👈
> * Breaking: Room predecessor support has been removed. Thanks, [#foundation-office:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#foundation-office:matrix.org)!
> * Rooms where a name had been set before but subsequently removed,
>   should now correctly pick an alternative name to display. No more "< small void where text is supposed to be >".
> * Made it easier to use custom types when reading events.
> * You can finally add mentions and newlines to messages.
>
> If you want to help out on these topics, please feel free to reach out at [#libmatrix:rory.gay](https://matrix.to/#/#libmatrix:rory.gay)!
> (N.B. Sorry, matrix.org users, the room is currently inaccessible. We hope to have this resolved soon!)
>
> ***And, as always:***

> * **Authenticated Media support**
> * **Options to remove media and redact events on user removal**
>
> The former one brings [Matrix 1.11 Authenticated Media](https://matrix.org/docs/spec-guides/authed-media-servers/)
> support to Synapse-Admin
>
> The latter one adds 2 toggles to the user erasure confirmation dialog:
>

> * [Redact all user's messages](https://element-hq.github.io/synapse/v1.116/admin_api/user_admin_api.html#redact-all-the-events-of-a-user)
>
> Apart from major changes, a bunch of small changes were made as well:
>
> * Unify media icons in the sidebar and on user's view page
> * Add proper previews for uploaded images and a download button for non-image uploads
> * Do not block rooms from joining on delete by default (to avoid accidental blocks)

### Matrix Rooms Search News ([website](https://github.com/etkecc/mrs))

[Aine [don't DM]](https://matrix.to/#/@aine:etke.cc) reports

> It's been a while since we posted MRS updates, so let's start with...
>
> **What is MRS?**
>
> Matrix Rooms Search (MRS) is a standalone search engine and Matrix Directory server that indexes Matrix servers with
> enabled federation and published room directory (over federation),
> after that you can search rooms across whole Matrix Federation either directly from your matrix client app
> ([details](https://github.com/etkecc/mrs/blob/main/docs/integrations.md#matrix-federation-api)),
> or by using [simple REST API](https://github.com/etkecc/mrs/blob/main/openapi.yml) of the MRS itself.
>
> **What's new?**
>
> Authenticated Media is here - now when you browse MRS using REST API
> (e.g. by using the demo server on [matrixrooms.info](https://matrixrooms.info)),
> room avatars will be fetched by the new Matrix v1.11 Authenticated Media endpoints (old unauthenticated media endpoint
> is still used as well, so there is a fallback).
>
> And another update - MRS now by default uses both exact match and fuzzy queries, so that should help will searching!
>
> [Source code](https://github.com/etkecc/mrs/),
