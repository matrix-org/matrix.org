### Extera

[OfficialDakari](https://matrix.to/#/@officialdakari:extera.xyz) reports

> Hello, everyone!
>
> During this week, a few things happened in Extera. Here is what changed:
>
> * Animations. Now, Extera has some animations in it. Member drawer opening/closing animation or navigating animation.
> * More material design. We made emoji&sticker pack settings use Material Design too.
> * A lot better threads! Threads are now really nearly usable. They now have different routes too.
> * Message menu in material design. Deleting and reporting messages form has Material Design too.
>
> Our server got some changes too:
>
> * Federation is now happening through Cloudflare WARP.
> * We've got Git instance!
>
> Also, we've started actively working on Extera Music (name is subject to change) - our alternative front-end
> for YouTube with playlists and a lot of cool things.

### Nheko ([website](https://nheko-reborn.github.io))

Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.

[Nico](https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev) announces

> Nothing much interesting to say currently, but one thing might be interesting to Nheko users:
>
> We noticed that http/3 increases the CPU usage of Nheko a lot (by 10-20x!) and makes the
> connection in general unstable.
> We use libcurl in the backend and depending on your distribution http/3 might get enabled by default.
> In my case this meant even when idle Nheko was using 10% or more CPU.
> The next release will disable http/3 by default for this reason.
> In my case this brings down CPU usage to 0.5% again, which is a noticeable improvement to battery life.
>
> Why the CPU usage increases this much with http/3 has a multitude of reasons (and isn't libcurl's fault,
> but more related to how http/3 works as well as some crypto library shenanigans).
> I won't go into the details there, but feel free to discuss this in
> [#nheko:nheko.im](https://matrix.to/#/#nheko:nheko.im).
> Specifically we were hoping for http/3 to improve the reconnection logic and
> make roaming between IPs a better experience.
> So far the opposite seems to be the case, but if you have any suggestions on what we could improve, they are very welcome!

## Dept of Widgets üß©

### NeoBoard Widget v1.20.0 ([website](https://neoboard.io))

[milton](https://matrix.to/#/@miltonmoura:matrix.org) announces

> Version 1.20.0 of NeoBoard is a small incremental update following 1.19.1 after a
> short month with a presentation at [The Matrix Conference](https://2024.matrix.org/watch/).
> This version brings the following updates:
>
> #### Disable Grid During Presentation
>
> We made the Presentation Mode easier to use by disabling the grid automatically when starting to present,
> and restoring it after presenting. Of course if you need it, you can still toggle it back on during presentation.
>
> #### Small Screen Improvements
>
> We also tweaked the bottom toolbars a bit: Some of the less important buttons are now hidden automatically
> so NeoBoard remains usable even when the available screen space is narrow.
> Enlarge the window, and they will reappear. ü™Ñ
>
> While we were at it, we also fixed an alignment issue in Safari, so we have the same experience on all platforms.
>
> You can get the full
> [release notes here](https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-neoboard/releases/tag/%40nordeck%2Fmatrix-neoboard-widget%401.20.0)
> and here's a reminder that you can always try it now:
> just add NeoBoard as a widget to one of your rooms by following [these instructions](https://nordeck.github.io/matrix-neoboard).
>
> We invite you to try all of this and would love to get some feedback at [#nordeck:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#nordeck:matrix.org).

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks üß∞

### Elm SDK ([website](https://github.com/noordstar/elm-matrix-sdk))

A more consistent alternative to the matrix-js-sdk, written in Elm.

[Bram](https://matrix.to/#/@bram:matrix.directory) announces

> _Zoooom!_ üèéÔ∏è The Elm SDK now supports all spec versions, including the new version 1.12!
>
> With this patch update, support now includes version 1.12 - but don't worry, old (even deprecated!)
> spec versions remain supported. The Elm SDK adapts its communication to whatever your homeserver supports,
> so **you can safely update your Elm library without needing to wait for your homeserver to update.**
> This design makes the SDK nearly trivial to update to the latest spec version - and hence very fast. _Zoooom!_

## Dept of Ops üõ†

### etke.cc ([website](https://etke.cc))

Your matrix server on your conditions

[Aine [don't DM]](https://matrix.to/#/@aine:etke.cc) says

> #### Synapse-Admin: Bugfixes & Improvements
>
> A while ago, we at
> [etke.cc announced our Synapse-Admin fork](https://etke.cc/news/xueua5a7nvgjzxldyu52gkw7viftcthp8cz-m3dyi_8/?utm_source=twim&utm_medium=matrix&utm_campaign=synapse-admin),
> and this week we are here with the fork news again.
>
> No significant changes were made this week (however, MAS users will like the-next-big-thing, even tho it's a workaround),
> this is more maintenance release with small QoL improvements:
>
> * [Better handling of restricted homeservers config](https://github.com/etkecc/synapse-admin/issues/56)
> * [Better federation page UI](https://github.com/etkecc/synapse-admin/issues/54) - now with icons!
> * Fix avatar sorting - apparently, the avatar field's sorting in the user's list was broken after the [React-Admin upgrade](https://github.com/etkecc/synapse-admin/pull/40)

## Dept of Bots ü§ñ

### communitybot plugin for maubot ([website](https://github.com/williamkray/maubot-communitybot))

[wreck](https://matrix.to/#/@william:mssj.me) announces

> _quick reminder for the uninitiated: the communitybot plugin is a maubot plugin to aid administrators of
> communities on matrix! it supports community management controls to make it easy to add new rooms to your Space,
> track inactive users, redact files or offensive messages in some or all of your rooms, and keep out the ne'er-do-wells._
>
> with the latest update for the communitybot plugin for maubot,
> **you can now have your bot subscribe to public ban lists** by having your bot join their room
> (like the CME banlist, included in the config by default!). when subscribed,
> the bot will automatically ban malicious/spam accounts when they join any of your rooms.
> this is read-only functionality, so if you're interested in publishing or defining your own policy lists,
> you will still be better served by a project like Draupnir.
>
> which begs the question: who should use this? the answer, as well as suggested community structure,
> are now in the readme. feel free to join [#dev:mssj.me](https://matrix.to/#/#dev:mssj.me) to discuss further or get help!
