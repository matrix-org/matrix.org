### Extera

[OfficialDakari](https://matrix.to/#/@officialdakari:extera.xyz) announces

> Hello again, users of the Matrix! It's been a week since last TWIM post and 2,5 months after first Extera commit!
> Anyway, here is what happened this week:
>
> * More animations! Developer found out about Framer-motion and now puts animations everywhere.
>   Jump to latest/unread buttons now slide into view instead of showing up instantly.
> * Fixed pinned messages request spam. Now pinned messages window doesn't DoS the homeserver.
> * Bubble layout improved again! Message timestamps are moved to the bottom of messages.
>   Also added icon indicating message status. It even tells if someone has read the message!
> * Redesigned emoji board and upload board. Upload board now looks like in Discord and more fits into Material UI.
> * Rust Crypto. Extera now uses Rust crypto because of recently disclosed vulnerability.
>
> Also, Extera's alt frontend for YT Music will be released very soon.
>
> Best regards,
> Extera ~~team~~ developer

> In non-bridge news, a couple weeks ago I finally started writing my own web client,

### Fractal ([website](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal))

Matrix messaging app for GNOME written in Rust.

[Kévin Commaille](https://matrix.to/#/@zecakeh:tedomum.net) says

> It's time to experience *La vie en rose*! We just released Fractal 9.rc and to show our support 🩷 for Breast Cancer
> Awareness Month, we decided to change the accent color to pink. And it is also packed with bug fixes, take a look for yourself:
>
> * We used to only rely on the secrets provider to tell us which Matrix accounts are logged-in,
>   which caused issues for people sharing their secrets between devices.
>   Now we also make sure that there is a data folder for a given session before trying to restore it.
> * Our notifications are categorized as coming from an instant messenger, so graphical shells that support it,
>   such as Phosh, can play a sound for them.
> * Some room settings are hidden for direct chats, because it does not make sense to change them in this type of room.
> * The size of the headerbar would change depending on whether the room has a topic or not. This will not happen anymore.
>
> As usual, this release includes other improvements, fixes and new translations thanks to all our contributors,
> and our upstream projects.
>
> It is available to install via Flathub Beta, see the [instructions in our README](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/fractal#installation-instructions).
>
> As the version implies,
> it should be mostly stable and we expect to only include minor improvements until the release of Fractal 9.
>
> If you are wondering what to do on a rainy day, you can try to fix one of our
> [newcomers issues](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/fractal/-/issues/?label_name%5B%5D=4.%20Newcomers).
> We are always looking for new contributors!

### Ement.el ([website](https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el))

Matrix client for Emacs

[alphapapa](https://matrix.to/#/@alphapapa:matrix.org) announces

> [Ement.el](https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el), a Matrix client for the
> [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) text editor and Lisp environment,
> has been [released](https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el/releases/tag/v0.16) at version 0.16.
> Changes since the last release include:
>
> **Compatibility**
>
> * Use authenticated media requests
>   (part of Matrix 1.11; see [MSC3916](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3916)
>   and [matrix.org's sunsetting unauthenticated media](https://matrix.org/blog/2024/06/26/sunsetting-unauthenticated-media/)).
>
> **Additions**
>
> * When option `ement-room-images` is disabled (preventing automatic download and display of images),
>   individual images may be shown by clicking the button in their events.
>
> **Changes**
>
> * Option `ement-room-coalesce-events` may now be set to (and defaults to) a maximum number of events to coalesce together.
>   (This avoids potential performance problems in rare cases.
>   See [#247](https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el/issues/247).
>   Thanks to [Arto Jantunen](https://github.com/viiru-) for reporting and
>   [Sergio Durigan Junior](https://github.com/sergiodj) for testing.)
>
> **Fixes**
>
> * Replies to edited messages are correctly sent to the original event
>   (whereas previously they were sent to the edit, which caused reactions to not be shown).
>   ([#230](https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el/issues/230),
>   [#277](https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el/issues/277).
>   Thanks to [Phil Sainty](https://github.com/phil-s) for suggesting,
>   and to [dionisos](https://github.com/dionisos2) for reporting.)
> * Set `filter-buffer-substring-function` in room buffers to prevent undesired text
>   properties from being included in copied text.
>   ([#278](https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el/pull/278).
>   Thanks to [Phil Sainty](https://github.com/phil-s).)
> * Command `ement-disconnect` no longer shows an error message.  ([#208](https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el/issues/208).)
> * Retrieval of earlier events in a just-joined room.  ([#148](https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el/issues/148).
>   Thanks to [Richard Brežák](https://github.com/MagicRB) for reporting,
>   and to [Phil Sainty](https://github.com/phil-s) for testing.)
> * Cache computed displaynames in rooms (avoiding unnecessary reiteration and recalculation).
>   ([#298](https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el/issues/298).
>   Thanks to [Rutherther](https://github.com/Rutherther) for reporting and testing, and to [Phil Sainty](https://github.com/phil-s).)
> * Customization group for options `ement-room-mode-hook` and `ement-room-self-insert-mode`.  (Thanks to [Phil Sainty](https://github.com/phil-s).)
> * Inheritance for some faces.  ([#303](https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el/pull/303).  Thanks to [Jonas Bernoulli](https://github.com/tarsius).)

### synadm ([website](https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm))

Command line admin tool for Synapse (Matrix homeserver)

[jacksonchen666 (they/it)](https://matrix.to/#/@jacksonchen666:jacksonchen666.com) says

> The documentation for synadm has been updated with 2 changes:
>
> 1. The most obvious theme change: You can see the **new docs theme** on <https://synadm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>
>    right now (compared to <https://synadm.readthedocs.io/en/v0.46.1/>)
> 2. There is now an **[API to CLI mapping page for synadm](https://synadm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features.html)**,
>    linking to the
>    [Synapse Admin API docs](https://element-hq.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html)
>    and the synadm command that uses the linked Synapse Admin API.
>    This is useful for seeing what's implemented and what's not, or if you forgot which command does what you want.
>
> That's roughly all the big changes. We also want to thank everyone who has contributed so far,
> and at the same time welcome new contributors.
> The “API to CLI Mapping” docs chapter was created to give a clear overview of what synadm can do and
> what’s not yet implemented. Check it out, use it, come and join
> [#synadm:peek-a-boo.at](https://matrix.to/#/#synadm:peek-a-boo.at) and help us make synadm better and more feature complete!
