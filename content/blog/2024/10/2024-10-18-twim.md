### Extera

[OfficialDakari](https://matrix.to/#/@officialdakari:extera.xyz) announces

> Hello again, users of the Matrix! It's been a week since last TWIM post and 2,5 months after first Extera commit!
> Anyway, here is what happened this week:
> * More animations! Developer found out about Framer-motion and now puts animations everywhere. Jump to latest/unread buttons now slide into view instead of showing up instantly.
> * Fixed pinned messages request spam. Now pinned messages window doesn't DoS the homeserver.
> * Bubble layout improved again! Message timestamps are moved to the bottom of messages. Also added icon indicating message status. It even tells if someone has read the message! 
> * Redesigned emoji board and upload board. Upload board now looks like in Discord and more fits into Material UI.
> * Rust Crypto. Extera now uses Rust crypto because of recently disclosed vulnerability.
> 
> Also, Extera's alt frontend for YT Music will be released very soon.
> 
> Best regards,
> Extera ~~team~~ developer

> This month's bridge releases include the WhatsApp bridge upgrading to the Megabridge architecture as well as small bugfixes for other bridges.
> 
> In non-bridge news, a couple weeks ago I finally started writing my own web client, and now gomuks web is starting to be usable enough for chatting. At some point in the future, I'll migrate the gomuks terminal UI over to the new framework as well.

### Fractal ([website](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal))

Matrix messaging app for GNOME written in Rust.

[Kévin Commaille](https://matrix.to/#/@zecakeh:tedomum.net) says

> It's time to experience _La vie en rose_! We just released Fractal 9.rc and to show our support 🩷 for Breast Cancer Awareness Month, we decided to change the accent color to pink. And it is also packed with bug fixes, take a look for yourself:
> 
> * We used to only rely on the secrets provider to tell us which Matrix accounts are logged-in, which caused issues for people sharing their secrets between devices. Now we also make sure that there is a data folder for a given session before trying to restore it.
> * Our notifications are categorized as coming from an instant messenger, so graphical shells that support it, such as Phosh, can play a sound for them.
> * Some room settings are hidden for direct chats, because it does not make sense to change them in this type of room.
> * The size of the headerbar would change depending on whether the room has a topic or not. This will not happen anymore.
> 
> As usual, this release includes other improvements, fixes and new translations thanks to all our contributors, and our upstream projects.
> 
> It is available to install via Flathub Beta, see the [instructions in our README](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/fractal#installation-instructions).
> 
> As the version implies, it should be mostly stable and we expect to only include minor improvements until the release of Fractal 9.
> 
> If you are wondering what to do on a rainy day, you can try to fix one of our [newcomers issues](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/fractal/-/issues/?label_name%5B%5D=4.%20Newcomers). We are always looking for new contributors!

### Ement.el ([website](https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el))

Matrix client for Emacs

[alphapapa](https://matrix.to/#/@alphapapa:matrix.org) announces

>   [Ement.el](https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el), a Matrix client for the [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) text editor and Lisp environment, has been [released](https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el/releases/tag/v0.16) at version 0.16.  Changes since the last release include:
> 
>   **Compatibility**
> 
>   -   Use authenticated media requests (part of Matrix 1.11; see [MSC3916](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3916) and [matrix.org's sunsetting unauthenticated media](https://matrix.org/blog/2024/06/26/sunsetting-unauthenticated-media/)).
> 
>   **Additions**
> 
>   -   When option `ement-room-images` is disabled (preventing automatic download and display of images), individual images may be shown by clicking the button in their events.
> 
>   **Changes**
> 
>   -   Option `ement-room-coalesce-events` may now be set to (and defaults to) a maximum number of events to coalesce together.  (This avoids potential performance problems in rare cases.  See [#247](https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el/issues/247).  Thanks to [Arto Jantunen](https://github.com/viiru-) for reporting and [Sergio Durigan Junior](https://github.com/sergiodj) for testing.)
> 
>   **Fixes**
> 
>   -   Replies to edited messages are correctly sent to the original event (whereas previously they were sent to the edit, which caused reactions to not be shown).  ([#230](https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el/issues/230), [#277](https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el/issues/277).  Thanks to [Phil Sainty](https://github.com/phil-s) for suggesting, and to [dionisos](https://github.com/dionisos2) for reporting.)
>   -   Set `filter-buffer-substring-function` in room buffers to prevent undesired text properties from being included in copied text.  ([#278](https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el/pull/278).  Thanks to [Phil Sainty](https://github.com/phil-s).)
>   -   Command `ement-disconnect` no longer shows an error message.  ([#208](https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el/issues/208).)
>   -   Retrieval of earlier events in a just-joined room.  ([#148](https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el/issues/148).  Thanks to [Richard Brežák](https://github.com/MagicRB) for reporting, and to [Phil Sainty](https://github.com/phil-s) for testing.)
>   -   Cache computed displaynames in rooms (avoiding unnecessary reiteration and recalculation).  ([#298](https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el/issues/298).  Thanks to [Rutherther](https://github.com/Rutherther) for reporting and testing, and to [Phil Sainty](https://github.com/phil-s).)
>   -   Customization group for options `ement-room-mode-hook` and `ement-room-self-insert-mode`.  (Thanks to [Phil Sainty](https://github.com/phil-s).)
>   -   Inheritance for some faces.  ([#303](https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el/pull/303).  Thanks to [Jonas Bernoulli](https://github.com/tarsius).)

### Element X iOS ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios))

A total rewrite of Element-iOS using the Matrix Rust SDK underneath and targeting devices running iOS 16+.

[Mauro Romito](https://matrix.to/#/@mauro.romito:element.io) says

> * Made some good progress on the knock join rule implementation
> * Some media upload optimisation were done client side to allow a more optimal media experience
> * Fixed some bugs in particular a nasty one that did not allow images to be opened when sent from EXA
> * The identity banner will now always show the user id to reduce ambiguity

### Element X Android ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-android))

> * The identity banner will now always show the user id to reduce ambiguity
> * Working on various features like room knock and incoming verification request.
> * Fixing many bugs and polishing the app, in particular microphone lost when background-ing the app during a call on Android 14.

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰

### Rory&::MatrixUtils - General utility suite for Matrix

[Emma [it/its]](https://matrix.to/#/@emma:rory.gay) reports

## Dept of Ops 🛠

### synadm ([website](https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm))

Command line admin tool for Synapse (Matrix reference homeserver)

[jacksonchen666 (they/it)](https://matrix.to/#/@jacksonchen666:jacksonchen666.com) says

> The documentation for synadm has been updated with 2 changes:
> 1. The most obvious theme change: You can see the **new docs theme** on <https://synadm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/> right now (compared to <https://synadm.readthedocs.io/en/v0.46.1/>)
> 2. There is now an **[API to CLI mapping page for synadm](https://element-hq.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html)**, linking to the [Synapse Admin API docs](https://element-hq.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html) and the synadm command that uses the linked Synapse Admin API. This is useful for seeing what's implemented and what's not, or if you forgot which command does what you want.
> 
> That's roughly all the big changes. We also want to thank everyone who has contributed so far, and at the same time welcome new contributors. The “API to CLI Mapping” docs chapter was created to give a clear overview of what synadm can do and what’s not yet implemented. Check it out, use it, come and join [#synadm:peek-a-boo.at](https://matrix.to/#/#synadm:peek-a-boo.at) and help us make synadm better and more feature complete!

> ### Synapse-Admin Updates
> 
> A while back, we at [etke.cc announced our Synapse-Admin fork](https://etke.cc/news/xueua5a7nvgjzxldyu52gkw7viftcthp8cz-m3dyi_8/?utm_source=twim&utm_medium=matrix&utm_campaign=synapse-admin), and this week we're excited to share a single major update, but oh boy, if you use MAS you'd love it!
> 
> **Login with Access Token** is here 🎉
> 
> Yes, that's not a full MAS compatibility, but at least now you can generate a proper token using `mas-cli` and use it as-is, without odd quirks like blocking access to specific endpoints to modify the token.
