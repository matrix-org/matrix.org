### Governing Board Elections 2024 - Voting Starts on May 18, 2024

[Thomas B](https://matrix.to/#/@thbr:matrix.org) says

> Only two weeks remain until the first Governing Board Elections.
>
> #### Who are the nominees?
>
> You can find the names of the nominees [on the election page](https://matrix.org/governing-board/elections/2024/#nominees), but who are they, and what are their visions for the future?
> The nominees' campaigning has been underway since April 27. Members of the ecosystem are already quite active at [#ecosystem.forum:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#ecosystem.forum:matrix.org). Feel free to join and meet the nominees for the ecosystem members group.
>
> Please, other constituencies, also find a place to meet, greet, and chat with members where people can get to know you better.
>
> With Josh Simmons (away, back May 9th)'s permission, I opened the space [#governing-board-nominee-campaigning-bonfire:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#governing-board-nominee-campaigning-bonfire:matrix.org) with several rooms for the different constituency groups.

## Dept of Spec 📜

[Andrew Morgan (anoa)](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io) says

> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <https://spec.matrix.org/proposals>.
>
>
> ### MSC Status
>
> **New MSCs:**
>
> * *There were no new MSCs this week.*
>
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
>
> * *No MSCs are in FCP.*
>
> **Accepted MSCs:**
>
> * *No MSCs were accepted this week.*
>
> **Closed MSCs:**
>
> * [MSC3903: X25519 Elliptic-curve Diffie-Hellman ephemeral for establishing secure channel between two Matrix clients](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3903)
> * [MSC3906: Mechanism to allow sign in and E2EE set up via QR code](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3906)
> * [MSC3886: Simple client rendezvous capability](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3886)
> * [[WIP] MSC2697: Device dehydration](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2697)
>
> Don't panic; each of those MSCs were closed in favour of new MSCs that superseded them.
>
> ### Spec Updates
>
> The Matrix.org Foundation is gearing up for [elections of the Governing Board](https://matrix.org/governing-board/elections/2024/). The Governing Board will influence the future direction of Matrix, and is made up of 9 constituencies. The Spec Core Team is one of these constituencies, alongside community members, individuals from sponsors, the managing director etc. In our case, the Spec Core Team may put forward two members to be part of the Governing Board, and only members of the Spec Core Team will vote on who this will be.
>
> So far we have received several nominations from within the team; you can view the [full list of nominations for each constituency](https://matrix.org/governing-board/elections/2024/#nominees).
>
> Of course, that still leaves 8 other constituencies, some with more than two members. Whether you're a company or an individual, learn how you can put your own name in the hat [here](https://matrix.org/membership/)!
>
> On a somewhat separate topic, a reminder that the next release of the Matrix spec, v1.11, is expected this month (May). Stay tuned for more news on that front soon.
>
> ### Random MSC of the Week
>
> The random MSC of the week is... [MSC4000: Forwards fill (`/backfill` forwards)](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4000)!
>
> This MSC defines a new Federation API endpoint, `GET /_matrix/federation/v1/forwards_fill/{roomId}`, which differs from [`/backfill`](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.10/server-server-api/#get_matrixfederationv1backfillroomid) in it allows you to fetch events that occurred "later" in the DAG. (It also differs in that the events provided are not also included in the response, but that's less relevant here.)
>
> I initially wondered why this MSC is actually useful. To me, `/backfill` makes intuitive sense. If you receive an event that has a `prev_events` or `auth_events` field referencing an event ID you don't know about, you'd call `/backfill` on other homeservers asking if they had that event. But how would you know that you lack an event that's forward ("later") in the DAG?
>
> It appears that the mechanism here would be different. You wouldn't know - so you'd eagerly ask this question, seeing whether you got anything back that you didn't know about.
>
> A use case for this is when a client calls [`/context`](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.10/client-server-api/#get_matrixclientv3roomsroomidcontexteventid) on an event, which gives you the events "around" it. Today, the homeserver gives you the surrounding events that it knows about. But what if there's a gap in the DAG? This can happen if you or another homeserver in a room is on an unreliable connection, and that other homeserver failed to inform you that they sent an event.
>
> Typically this is resolved by receiving a later event which references one of the ones you're missing; you'd call `/backfill` using the later event on a homeserver that has the event you're missing.
>
> But what if that later event hasn't been sent yet? It can be useful to have a *proactive* method of asking for missing events. That's the gap in functionality that `/forwards_fill` can fill (I'm sorry).
>
> If you find the prospect of this endpoint useful, head over to the MSC and leave your feedback as a PR review comment.

## Dept of Clients 📱

### Fractal ([website](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal))

Matrix messaging app for GNOME written in Rust.

[Kévin Commaille](https://matrix.to/#/@zecakeh:tedomum.net) reports

> Here comes ~~the bride~~ Fractal 7, with extended encryption support and improved accessibility. Server-side key backup and account recovery have been added, bringing greater security. Third-party verification has received some bug fixes and improvements. Amongst the many accessibility improvements, navigability has increased, especially in the room history. But that’s not all we’ve been up to in the past three months:
>
> * Messages that failed to send can now be retried or discarded.
> * Messages can be reported to server admins for moderation.
> * Room details are now considered complete, with the addition of room address management, permissions, and room upgrade.
> * A new member menu appears when clicking on an avatar in the room history. It offers a quick way to do many actions related to that person, including opening a direct chat with them and moderating them.
> * Pills are clickable and allow to directly go to a room or member profile.
>
> As usual, this release includes other improvements, fixes and new translations thanks to all our contributors, and our upstream projects.
>
> We want to address special thanks to the translators who worked on this version. We know this is a huge undertaking and have a deep appreciation for what you’ve done. If you want to help with this effort, head over to [Damned Lies](https://l10n.gnome.org/).
>
> It is available right now on [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/org.gnome.Fractal).
>
> We are already hard at work for our next release, so if you want to give us a hand you can start by looking at our [Newcomer issues](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/fractal/-/issues/?state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=4.%20Newcomers) or just come say hello in [our Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#fractal:gnome.org).

### Element X iOS ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios))

A total rewrite of Element-iOS using the Matrix Rust SDK underneath and targeting devices running iOS 16+.

[Doug](https://matrix.to/#/@douge:matrix.org) says

> * 🔗 Permalink support is finished and will be available in next week’s release candidate! This includes support for users, rooms and events along with navigating to replies.
> * 🪄 Logging in with a QR code works and its truly magical! We’ve now seen plenty of successful test logins using this flow and are finishing off some error handling for the feature to be complete.
> * 🔔 We’ve finally added support for mentioning users when the Rich Text Editor is disabled. This gives markdown input parity with RTE and along with the recent change to use a plain text field, makes it the most reliable text input choice.

### Element X Android ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-android))

Android Matrix messenger application using the Matrix Rust Sdk and Jetpack Compose

[Jorge](https://matrix.to/#/@jorgem:element.io) says

> This week has been really quiet since we have been focused on continuing the development of two features:
>
> * Permalinks: we fixed a couple of bugs related to navigation and have been working on getting navigating to an event and external links working so opening a `matrix.to` or `element.io` link will redirect you to the right room, user or event in a room.
> * QR code login: more polishing work has been done in preparation for the feature to be completed in other platforms.
> * Besides that, we worked on fixing some annoying bugs related to internal app versioning and migrations and minor design issues, as well as some rich text editor fixes to be included soon.

>
> Just a small progress update on basics this time around :)
>
> I've figured out the basic semantics for having a project room, and a workaround for servers missing `/state/x/y?format=event`! The basic addition of issues has also been implemented.

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰

[Johannes](https://matrix.to/#/@h3nn3s:matrix.org) says

> For those trying to use matrix-js-sdk in React Native, <https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rn-sdk> has been dusted off. It's now written in TS and provides a crypto store that is compatible with the latest version of matrix-js-sdk (if used with the legacy ASM build of libolm).
>
> It's important to note that this won't work anymore once the libolm crypto code has been removed from matrix-js-sdk. The new Rust crypto library is not injectable in the same way, both because this feature hasn't been added in matrix-js-sdk and because its much bigger than libolm which makes bundling the ASM [infeasible](https://github.com/element-hq/element-web/issues/26922#issuecomment-2083417850).

[Emma [it/its]](https://matrix.to/#/@emma:rory.gay) announces

> ### Rory&::MatrixUtils - General utility suite for Matrix
>
> [Rory&::MatrixUtils](https://mru.rory.gay) is *the* oldest project in the Rory&::LibMatrix suite of projects. *Did you know that LibMatrix used to be called `MatrixRoomUtils.Core`?*
> In case you weren't already aware of Rory&::MatrixUtils, it's a general suite of tools aimed towards more niche or specific tasks, such as debugging space relations, migrating accounts, managing room profiles, etc.
>
> In addition, it also has some more general nice-to-haves, such as being a native [MSC3784](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3784) client (policy lists are identified by room type, mainly used for the Policy Editor), tooling to migrate a room across upgrades after a room split, support for Synapse's room query API with additional filters (eg. member count).
> In addition it also has quite a few moderation-related utilities, such as being able to modify some Mjolnir/Draupnir account data entries such as the protected room list.
> All in all, it's meant to offer dedicated tools to achieve a lot of "niche" tasks, and if you feel like you need a specific manual tool, feel free to reach out!
>
> The "first party" instance is available at <https://mru.rory.gay>, and is a clientside-only web app!
>
> ***And, as with all of the other projects:***
>
> * The code is available at [cgit.rory.gay](https://cgit.rory.gay/matrix/tools/MatrixUtils.git/)!
>   * All contributions are more than welcome, be it documentation, code, layout/UI/UX improvements, anything!
> * Discussion, suggestions and ideas are welcome in [#mru:rory.gay](https://matrix.to/#/#mru:rory.gay)

[Emma [it/its]](https://matrix.to/#/@emma:rory.gay) announces

> ### Rory&::LibMatrix (.NET 8 matrix bot/client library/SDK)
>
> Some new features and bug fixes this time around, including work on HomeserverEmulator.
>
> #### Additions
>
> * Added `LibMatrixException` to denote internal exceptions, such as when attempting to use a feature that a given homeserver implementation doesn't support.
> * Added `Room.GetStateEventIdAsync(string type, string stateKey = "", bool fallbackToSync = true)` in order to get the event ID for a given state event
>   * Warning: this requires a homeserver implementation that supports `/state/x/y?format=event` properly though falling back to sync will be attempted unless disabled (to my knowledge only Conduwuit supports this).
> * HSE: Added resolving room aliases via room directory.
> * HSE: Added event relations endpoints, at least partially.
>
> #### Changes
>
> * `_hs.GetJoinedRoomsByType(string)` now optionally takes an integer to limit concurrent requests.
> * Fixed `Room.JoinAsync()` not correctly splitting room ID to add a default `via` if none are provided.
> * HSE: Fixed a bug that caused attempting to download media to freeze the server and burn CPU?
> * HSE: Optimised room ID to room mapping.
> * HSE: Fixed a race condition that may cause rooms to not be mapped by ID after creation
> * HSE: Fixed room creation not actually causing the room to be considered valid despite returning a room ID.
> * HSE: Fixed handling of user profile.
> * HSE: Fixed ASP.NET Core attempting to wrongly apply model validation (by disabling it wholesale)
> * HSE: Optimised room lookup by ID
> * HSE: Room.SetStateInternal now takes in the relevant user rather than setting `sender = ""`
> * HSE: Room state cache is now only rebuilt if timeline has changed.
>
> ***And, as always:***
>
> * The code is available at [cgit.rory.gay](https://cgit.rory.gay/matrix/LibMatrix.git)!
>   * All contributions are more than welcome, be it documentation, code, anything! Perhaps, example usecases, bots, ...?
> * Discussion, suggestions and ideas are welcome in [#libmatrix:rory.gay](https://matrix.to/#/#libmatrix:rory.gay) (Space: [#mru-space:rory.gay](https://matrix.to/#/#mru-space:rory.gay))

> [Florian](https://www.dsn.kastel.kit.edu/staff_jacob.php) from the [Decentralized Systems and Network Services research group](https://www.dsn.kastel.kit.edu/) of [KIT university](https://www.kit.edu/) reports:
>
> In our research, we decompose practical decentralized systems to match them to decentralized systems theory, and bring that theory back to practice. 🧪 Many practical decentralized systems share a common core of “a set of events ordered in time by predecessor hashes”, like the Matrix event graph. By unifying this core as a "hash chronicle" [conflict-free replicated data type](https://crdt.tech), we show that hash chronicles act as a fault-tolerant, logical clocks that order events ⏱️. Hash chronicles and derived systems can achieve monotonicity (next state is higher / bigger / greater / older than the current state), which we show to be a strong security property despite being implicit in practical system designs.
>
> You can read all about it in our newest publication, [Logical Clocks and Monotonicity for Byzantine-Tolerant Replicated Data Types](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3642976.3653034), at this year's [Workshop on Principles and Practice of Consistency for Distributed Data](https://papoc-workshop.github.io/2024/).
