[Josh Simmons (m.org)](https://matrix.to/#/@joshsimmons:matrix.org) announces

> We had our first Governing Board gathering today at the Matrix Conference in Berlin, with 17 of the 20 members present (4 of which joined remotely)! We got to know each other a little better and discussed many things including Trust & Safety and how we communicate with each other and with the community.
>
> Since this wasn't an official meeting, no votes were taken. The first official meeting of the Governing Board will be taking place soon!

## Dept of Bridges 🌉

### [Parsee](https://kappach.at/parsee) - the jealous XMPP-Matrix bridge

[LDA](https://matrix.to/#/@fourier:ari.lt) reports

> Haven't worked that much compared to the last three months(kinda am
> at a somewhat important year with school), but I've fixed up some
> issues and started adding PEP avatars this week, with VCard-based ones
> coming right up later, and got up static CI builds with some experimental
> MbedTLS to replace the previous OpenSSL/LibreSSL in that regard(bringing in
> binaries in the ~2MBs compared to the previous 5(!)).
> Will probably be working on more important user concerns, mostly
> involving the syntax for bridged users/MUCs and actual documentation for
> regular users, though except slightly less time allocated to the project,
> as I said, I got school, and a slightly more interesting project I have
> to contribute to that has already gone pretty far!

### Megabridge

[tulir](https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net) announces

> This month's mautrix releases include the first megabridge releases of the Meta and Google Messages bridges, as well as a new Google Voice bridge.

## Dept of Non Chat Clients 🎛️

### WorkAdventure is now a Matrix client

[David Négrier](https://matrix.to/#/@dan:workadventu.re) says

> We are thrilled to announce that [WorkAdventure](https://workadventu.re) — the open, decentralized platform for building 2D virtual offices and events — is now also a Matrix client! Every WorkAdventure user will now have a Matrix account automatically created.
>
> {{ youtube_player(video_id="UGHK63mQTz8") }}
>
> This is a huge win for WorkAdventure users. Even when someone is not connected to WorkAdventure, they can still be contacted through a Matrix client like Element X on a mobile phone, directly from WorkAdventure.
>
> We believe this will also be a significant benefit for the Matrix community, as it opens a new use case for Matrix that makes it stand out from other messaging apps.
>
> #### Technical details
>
> From a technical point of view:
>
> * The client is developed in Svelte JS.
> * Provides an OIDC-aware connection to the Matrix server.
> * Supports end-to-end encryption.
>
> I will present the new client —including insights on how we developed it— at Matrix Conf 2024 on Saturday, September 21st.

## Dept of Ops 🛠

### Rory&::MatrixUtils - General utility suite for Matrix

[Emma [it/its]](https://matrix.to/#/@emma:rory.gay) reports

> Lots of tools have been added, updated or reworked since the original post back in May!
>
> A short list of major changes:
>
> * A general tool list has been added, as well as a Labs section! Visit your nearest RMU instance to learn all about them!
> * Policy list editor can create new policies (*even in bulk!*, though beware, bulk addition is still very much in beta, "works but no guarantees")
> * Bulk writing of bans via Policy List Editor has deprecated the "Mass CME Ban" tool, which had been written to cover a very specific use case. This opens up the tooling for a lot more users, especially when dealing with spam waves!
> * Partial support for the concept of authenticated media, though I'd like to raise a severe epilepsy warning!
> * Lots of stability and improvements due to upstream Rory&::LibMatrix changes and improvements
> * Some tools have seen a 60%+ performance improvement! (Policy List Editor mainly)
> * Membership history viewer is now more informative about what actually changed, enabling more uses for the tool
> * Joining a space's children is now recursive
>
> The "first party" instance is available at <https://mru.rory.gay>, and is a clientside-only web app!
> If RMU has provided value in your daily routines or as a one time thing, please do consider donating over at [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/RorySys)!
>
> ***And, as with all of the other projects:***
>
> * The code is available at [cgit.rory.gay](https://cgit.rory.gay/matrix/tools/MatrixUtils.git/)!
>   * All contributions are more than welcome, be it documentation, code, layout/UI/UX improvements, anything!
> * Discussion, suggestions and ideas are welcome in [#mru:rory.gay](https://matrix.to/#/#mru:rory.gay)
>
> {{figureVideo(vid="/blog/img/matrix_utils_22_09_24.webm",caption="A demo of the new policy editor features")}}

### Rory&::LibMatrix (.NET 8 matrix bot/client library/SDK)

> It's been a few weeks since I've last posted an update, hasn't it?
>
> #### Changes
>
> * Support for authenticated media has been implemented. You should be able to load images again!
> * Single HTTP client implementation has been merged, network connections should now be more responsive!
> * Unit tests have been fixed, this should help catch bugs more reliably to ensure stability
> * JSON canonicalisation code has been merged, which passes all tests from spec. If you find an incorrect case, please do submit patches to add them to the unit tests!
> * Fixed a bug where joining a room that allows viewing history without joining would fail.
> * Fixed a bug with sending state events that contain special characters in state keys (eg. `/`). Bots & clients no longer need to work around this.
> * Added a function to the base Policy content class to calculate a Draupnir-compatible state key, this allows moderation bot authors to easily be in line with Draupnir's state keys :)
>
> ##### Pending changes
>
> * Add some more utility functions to make developer UX more friendly.
> * Reduced log output so you can follow what's actually going on.
> * Fixed a bug that causes sync to break completely due to trusting event schemas too much.
>
> ##### Changes on ModerationClient's LibMatrix branch
>
> * Support for storing sync data offline, allowing users to not do an initial sync every time the app is reloaded
> * Fixed some bugs with how sync changes are processed. Messages should no longer disappear
> * Optimised sync processing, didn't benchmark but it's noticeably faster for most users. Maybe by a factor of 20x?
> * Added support for a whole load of Synapse admin API's. Client authors can now include support for deactivating users, managing the media repository, and so much more!
> * Partial support for Custom profile properties (MSC 4133), though this will land in main branch independently!
>
> #### Project interests
>
> * Licensing: Have you been put off by our choice of AGPL v3? We'd love to hear about it! Is there a better license we could use? Do you have suggestions on how we could maybe implement exemptions?
> * Packaging & testing: We would like to get a CI pipeline and packaging going. Are you experienced with Git? We'd love to have you on board to ensure that our packages are as easy to install & use as possible!
> * Public code browsing accessibility: Would it help to set up read-only GitHub/GitLab/Codeberg/Forgejo mirrors? Would you be interested in contributing if these existed?
> * E2EE: Do you have experience with Matrix' E2EE? We'd love to hear from you in terms of implementing it in LibMatrix!
>
> If you want to help out on these topics, please feel free to reach out at #libmatrix:rory.gay!
> (N.B. Sorry, matrix.org users, the room is currently inaccessible. We hope to have this resolved soon!)
>
> #### RE: RE: Funding
>
> [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/RorySys) has been fixed! Donations help me pay my bills, and help me justify working on LibMatrix!
>
> ***And, as always:***
>
> * The code is available at [cgit.rory.gay](https://cgit.rory.gay/matrix/LibMatrix.git)!
>   * All contributions are more than welcome, be it documentation, code, anything! Perhaps, example usecases, bots, ...?
> * Discussion, suggestions and ideas are welcome in #libmatrix:rory.gay (Space: #mru-space:rory.gay)
> * Got a cool project that you're working on and want to share, using LibMatrix? Be sure to let us know, we'd love to hear all about it!
