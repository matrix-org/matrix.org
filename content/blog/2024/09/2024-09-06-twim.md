## Dept of Spec 📜

[TravisR](https://matrix.to/#/@travis:t2l.io) announces

> Earlier in the week matrix.org started requiring authentication to access media, and it looks like most users didn't notice (a good thing)! Smooth rollouts like this are thanks in large part to the developer ecosystem preparing users for the change with code - thank you to everyone who has been working hard at improving how media is shared in Matrix ❤️.
>
> There's always going to be problems which reveal themselves *after* the deployment happens, and it looks like most of the issues we're tracking have workarounds or patches on the way. If you're seeing errors for images/files, please update your client. Web users may need to refresh the page multiple times before things start working because of how browsers (don't) work. If you're still seeing issues, it may be a bug in your client: please report it to the developers so they can take a look.
>
> Developers, protocol designers, and future MSC writers may also be interested in ["Authenticated media & how to ship spec features"](https://cfp.matrix.org/matrixconf2024/talk/P9KPFG/) in LAB 4 at this year's Matrix Conference in just a couple of weeks! We'll be discussing how such a massive feature (and technically breaking change in the spec) gets designed, developed, and deployed with support from the MSC process - if you're thinking about how to get your idea for a feature out in the hands of users, this talk is for you. The advice should be transferable to features smaller than authenticated media too, hopefully 😇

## Dept of Servers 🏢

### conduwuit ([website](https://conduwuit.puppyirl.gay))

conduwuit is a very cool, featureful, well-maintained fork of Conduit

[strawberry🍓 (it/pup/she/they) 🏳️‍⚧️🦴💜🩷💖](https://matrix.to/#/@strawberry:puppygock.gay) reports

> [0.4.6 Release](https://github.com/girlbossceo/conduwuit/releases/tag/v0.4.6)
>
> Hi everyone! We're excited to announce the release of [conduwuit 0.4.6](https://github.com/girlbossceo/conduwuit/releases/tag/v0.4.6) 🎉. It's been a long time since our last release, and we hope the new features, bug fixes, and improvements make it worth the wait!
>
> There's so much I'd like to mention here, but here is an extremely brief overview of some highlights -
>
> #### **Major Highlights:**
>
> * **Authenticated Media**: Media endpoints are now authenticated by default, with no user or server admin intervention needed. If you'd like to disable legacy media endpoints, simply set `allow_legacy_media = false`. Huge thanks to my very talented primary co-maintainer, [@jason:uwu.zemos.net](https://matrix.to/#/@jason:uwu.zemos.net) for spearheading this!
> * **Improved Sliding Sync**: With the help of [@morguldir:sulian.eu](https://matrix.to/#/@morguldir:sulian.eu), we've resolved many Sliding Sync issues, making **Element X** a lot smoother to use on conduwuit. Fixes include support for heroes, timestamps, per-room account data, read receipts extension (MSC3960), room/client filters, seeing room invites, and more.
> * **Mautrix Bridge Support**: Added the appservice ping endpoint and MSC3316 timestamped massaging, making conduwuit more compatible with [Mautrix bridges](https://docs.mau.fi/bridges/general/using-bridges.html).
> * **Thread Fixes**: Thanks to [@isosphere:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/@isosphere:matrix.org) for a huge effort fixing backwards threads and other bugs, improving the experience on clients like Element Web/Desktop.
>
> #### **Admin Tools & Miscellaneous Updates:**
>
> * **Admin Commands**: Tons of new admin commands have been added for moderation, media cleanup, and debugging; run `!admin help` for a full list. And admin room misc improvements like log capture was added.
> * **Presence Status**: Clients can now set presence status messages correctly.
> * **Room Banning**: Improved room banning by removing aliases and unpublishing banned rooms.
> * **Federation Controls**: The `forbidden_remote_server_names` config option now blocks both inbound and outbound federation.
> * **Older Debian Compatibility**: Fixed install issues on older Debian versions.
> * **Codebase Improvements**: Extensive refactoring, optimizations, and the usual dependency bumps (including RocksDB v9.5.2 and Rust 1.80.1).
>
> For full details, including around **250 commits** since 0.4.5, check out the [commit history](https://github.com/girlbossceo/conduwuit/compare/v0.4.5...v0.4.6).

### Element ([website](https://element.io))

Everything related to Element but not strictly bound to a client

[Matthew](https://matrix.to/#/@matthew:matrix.org) reports

> After moving to AGPL for Synapse at the end of last year, Element is finalising the licence changes for the remaining related projects. We’ve also decided to switch the Element apps to (A)GPL. The intention is to ensure that system integrators and other proprietary forks of our software support its development, either by releasing their contributions or buying an alternative licence. <https://element.io/blog/sustainable-licensing-at-element-with-agpl/> has the details!

## Dept of Widgets 🧩

### Widgets & Authenticated Media

[Kim Brose](https://matrix.to/#/@kim.brose.nordeck:matrix.org) announces

> Since our last update, a couple things have happened in widget land, so we want to share some news with you today before we see you in 2 weeks at [The Matrix Conference](https://cfp.matrix.org/matrixconf2024/talk/SPDEYT/)!
>
> The more exiting updates to the [Matrix Widget Toolkit](https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-widget-toolkit) include the update to Material UI 6 as well as latest React and Redux, and support for Matrix v1.11's **Authenticated Media**!
>
> To get there, we updated/extended our [MSC4039: Access the Content repository with the Widget API](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4039) to account for downloads with Authenticated Media, Asynchronous Media Uploads, and encrypted media (we would welcome any feedback!). So far, we contributed reference implementations of the Authenticated Media parts to the [matrix-widget-api](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-widget-api/), released in [v1.9.0](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-widget-api/releases/tag/v1.9.0), and [Element's react-sdk](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/12931), besides our own packages. Async Media and e2ee media are to follow soon, watch this space! ;)
>
> With that, up to date package versions of the toolkit are now:
>
> * [@matrix-widget-toolkit/api@3.4.0](https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-widget-toolkit/releases/tag/%40matrix-widget-toolkit%2Fapi%403.4.0), with support for authenticated media downloads as specified in [MSC4039](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4039) and implemented in [v1.9.0](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-widget-api/releases/tag/v1.9.0) of the [matrix-widget-api](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-widget-api/)
> * [@matrix-widget-toolkit/react@2.0.1](https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-widget-toolkit/releases/tag/%40matrix-widget-toolkit%2Freact%402.0.1), now with various updated dependencies
> * [@matrix-widget-toolkit/mui@2.0.3](https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-widget-toolkit/releases/tag/%40matrix-widget-toolkit%2Fmui%402.0.3), now using Material UI 6
>
> and our [MUI Matrix Example Widget](https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-widget-toolkit/tree/main/example-widget-mui) was updated to demonstrate the toolkit's capabilities as usual.
>
> To try them out right now, we recommend using Element Web's [develop](https://develop.element.io/) or [nightly](https://element.io/download) builds. Or you can wait for Element Web's v1.11.77 release, which is planned for next week.
>
> If you have any questions or feedback, you can reach us at [Nordeck (public)](https://matrix.to/#/#nordeck:matrix.org).

## Dept of Interesting Projects 🛰️

### The Magic of Distributed Access Control

[Robin](https://matrix.to/#/@robin:robin.town) says

> Matrix room state is a curious thing. A while ago I was contemplating three, seemingly unrelated questions:
>
> * Are [periodic room upgrades](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3901) really the only way to delete state?
> * Is a complex state resolution algorithm really the only way to implement distributed access control?
> * What if room state could embed, or simply take the form of, an arbitrary CRDT?
>
> When it clicked that these *were* related, this put me on the quest to develop an access control technique with transparent semantics that could be applied to any eventually consistent system. And, I think I've hit upon something pretty promising! The full story is on my blog: <https://robin.town/blog/distributed-access-control>
>
> I don't know yet whether this idea might inform future development of Matrix, but I hope it's interesting! Feedback is appreciated :)
