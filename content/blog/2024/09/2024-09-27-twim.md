### Synapse ([website](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/))

Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by Element

[Devon Dmytro](https://matrix.to/#/@devonh:one.ems.host) announces

> This week we released [v1.116.0rc2](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/releases/tag/v1.116.0rc2). Here are a few of the highlights:
> 
> * Guests can now use the new media endpoints to download media, as described by [MSC4189](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4189)
> * Add initial implementation of delayed events as proposed by [MSC4140](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4140)
> * Add implementation of restricting who can overwrite a state event as proposed by [MSC3757](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3757)
> * Add an asynchronous Admin API endpoint [to redact all of a user's events](https://element-hq.github.io/synapse/v1.116/admin_api/user_admin_api.html#redact-all-the-events-of-a-user), and [an endpoint to check on the status of that redaction task](https://element-hq.github.io/synapse/v1.116/admin_api/user_admin_api.html#check-the-status-of-a-redaction-process)
> 
> ...and a whole lot more. Check out the release notes for the full set of changes!
> Thank you to all our contributors for helping to make Synapse the best it can be.
> As always, feel free to stop by [#synapse:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#synapse:matrix.org) to join in on the discussion and if you encounter a bug make sure to report it [here](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/issues/new/choose).

### Fractal ([website](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal))

Matrix messaging app for GNOME written in Rust.

[Kévin Commaille](https://matrix.to/#/@zecakeh:tedomum.net) says

> Back to school, and Fractal is back too! The leaves are starting to cover the floor in our part of the globe, but you don’t have to shake a tree to get our goodness packed into Fractal 9.beta:
> 
> * We switched to the glycin library (the same one used by GNOME Image Viewer) to load images, allowing us to fix several issues, like supporting more animated formats and SVGs and respecting EXIF orientation.
> * The annoying bug where some rooms would stay as unread even after opening them is now a distant memory.
> * The media cache uses its own database that you can delete if you want to free some space on your system. It will also soon be able to clean up unused media files to prevent it from growing indefinitely.
> * Sometimes the day separators would show up with the wrong date, not anymore!
> * We migrated to the new GTK 4.16 and libadwaita 1.6 APIs, including CSS variables, AdwButtonRow and AdwSpinner.
> 
> As usual, this release includes other improvements, fixes and new translations thanks to all our contributors, and our upstream projects.
> 
> It is available to install via Flathub Beta, see the [instructions in our README](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/fractal#installation-instructions).
> 
> As the version implies, there might be a slight risk of regressions, but it should be mostly stable. If all goes well the next step is the release candidate!
> 
> If you have a little bit of time on your hands, you can try to fix one of our [newcomers issues](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/fractal/-/issues/?label_name%5B%5D=4.%20Newcomers). Anyone can make Fractal better!

### Element X iOS ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios))

A total rewrite of Element-iOS using the Matrix Rust SDK underneath and targeting devices running iOS 16+.

[Doug](https://matrix.to/#/@douge:matrix.org) reports

> * This week brings the Release Candidate for v1.8.4 to TestFlight which amongst other things enables Message Pinning - long press on a message and tap Pin to try it out yourself!
> * v1.8.4 is also our first build to use Xcode 16 which should fix some iOS 18-related bugs and we’ve been fixing any smaller bugs that we’ve encountered as the week has progressed.
> * Lots of time has been spent on our tests (some of which fell apart a little after the Xcode 16 upgrade), and hopefully we’ll soon be back to enjoying a stable suite of tests.
> * Finally we’re tackling the big AGPL migration and are updating Element iOS Classic, Compound iOS and the Rich Text Editor to be inline with all of our Element licenses.

### Element X Android ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-android))

Android Matrix messenger application using the Matrix Rust SDK and Jetpack Compose.

[ganfra](https://matrix.to/#/@ganfra:matrix.org) reports

> * This week we've released version 0.6.4 to Google Play Open Testing.
> Message Pinning is now stable - long press on a message and tap Pin to try it out yourself!
> * We have spend most of our time fixing bugs and improving code, including tests.
> * Finally we’re tackling the AGPL migration on various projects to be inline with all of our Element licenses.

### etke.cc ([website](https://etke.cc))

Your matrix server on your conditions

[Aine [don't DM]](https://matrix.to/#/@aine:etke.cc) says

> A while back, we at [etke.cc announced our Synapse-Admin fork](https://etke.cc/news/xueua5a7nvgjzxldyu52gkw7viftcthp8cz-m3dyi_8/?utm_source=twim&utm_medium=matrix&utm_campaign=synapse-admin), and this week we're excited to share two major updates:
> 
> * **Upgrade to React Admin v5**
> * **Restrictions on modifying specific users**
> 
> The React Admin upgrade enhances the Synapse-Admin UI experience, especially if you found the previous dark theme too high-contrast.
> 
> The second update is a quality-of-life improvement you've always wanted but may not have known you needed. 🙂
> 
> Previously, we introduced a feature to prevent users from accidentally deleting their sole homeserver administrator account.
> 
> Now, we're addressing another common issue: inadvertently altering system user accounts managed by appservices (such as bridges and bots). Editing, deleting, locking, or changing the passwords of these appservice-managed accounts can cause serious problems. To prevent this, we've added a new feature that blocks these types of modifications to such accounts, while still allowing other risk-free changes (changing display names and avatars). By defining a list of MXID regex patterns in the new `asManagedUsers` configuration setting, you can protect these accounts from accidental changes.
> 
> If you're using [matrix-docker-ansible-deploy](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/), the playbook automatically handles this configuration setting to ensure appservice-managed user accounts remain safe.

### AlexGames: simple Lua/Rust WebAssembly powered board games running in a Matrix widget

[axby](https://matrix.to/#/@axby:matrix.org) announces

> I put together a collection of simple board games written in Lua and Rust, built them to WebAssembly, and focused on a standalone web application that relies on a websocket server for multiplayer. I tried swapping out the websocket server for the Matrix widget API, and it works! This means that all you need is the static HTML/JS/WASM hosted on a server, and you can add a widget to a small Matrix room like this:
> 
> `/addwidget https://alexbarry.net/dev/games/matrix-widget/?matrix_widget_id=$matrix_widget_id&matrix_user_id=$matrix_user_id`
> 
> And you can play games with a friend, using Element web or desktop. No other server side handling required!
> 
> Here's a demo video, two Element web sessions playing chess together, using the Matrix room for game state changes: https://youtu.be/a\_uR0tPeR18?t=15
> 
> Source code is [available in a branch on GitHub here](https://github.com/alexbarry/AlexGames/tree/matrix-widget), and feel free to join [#alexgames:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#alexgames:matrix.org) if you're interested in more, or want to find someone to try a game with. To try the standalone web version, you can visit https://alexbarry.github.io/AlexGames/ . I'd be happy to update and polish the Matrix widget version if there's interest. I also set up my project so that you could write your own games in Lua and upload them to the existing web/matrix version, without having to build the project. See my [very simple API](https://alexbarry.github.io/AlexGames/game_api_doc.html) (e.g. `draw_rectangle`, `handle_user_clicked`) and the [API demo example game](https://github.com/alexbarry/AlexGames/tree/main/src/lua_scripts/games/api_demo).
