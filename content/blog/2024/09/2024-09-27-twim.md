### Synapse ([website](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/))

Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by Element

[Devon Dmytro](https://matrix.to/#/@devonh:one.ems.host) announces

> This week we released [v1.116.0rc2](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/releases/tag/v1.116.0rc2).
> Here are a few of the highlights:
>
> * Guests can now use the new media endpoints to download media, as described by [MSC4189](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4189)
> * Add initial implementation of delayed events as proposed by [MSC4140](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4140)
> * Add implementation of restricting who can overwrite a state event as proposed by [MSC3757](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3757)
> * Add an asynchronous Admin API endpoint
>   [to redact all of a user's events](https://element-hq.github.io/synapse/v1.116/admin_api/user_admin_api.html#redact-all-the-events-of-a-user),
>   and [an endpoint to check on the status of that redaction task](https://element-hq.github.io/synapse/v1.116/admin_api/user_admin_api.html#check-the-status-of-a-redaction-process)
>
> ...and a whole lot more. Check out the release notes for the full set of changes!

### Fractal ([website](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal))

Matrix messaging app for GNOME written in Rust.

[Kévin Commaille](https://matrix.to/#/@zecakeh:tedomum.net) says

> Back to school, and Fractal is back too! The leaves are starting to cover the floor in our part of the globe,
> but you don’t have to shake a tree to get our goodness packed into Fractal 9.beta:
>
> * We switched to the glycin library (the same one used by GNOME Image Viewer) to load images,
>   allowing us to fix several issues, like supporting more animated formats and SVGs and respecting EXIF orientation.
> * The annoying bug where some rooms would stay as unread even after opening them is now a distant memory.
> * The media cache uses its own database that you can delete if you want to free some space on your system.
>   It will also soon be able to clean up unused media files to prevent it from growing indefinitely.
> * Sometimes the day separators would show up with the wrong date, not anymore!
> * We migrated to the new GTK 4.16 and libadwaita 1.6 APIs, including CSS variables, AdwButtonRow and AdwSpinner.
>
> As usual, this release includes other improvements, fixes and new translations thanks to all our contributors,
> and our upstream projects.
>
> It is available to install via Flathub Beta, see the [instructions in our README](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/fractal#installation-instructions).
>
> As the version implies, there might be a slight risk of regressions, but it should be mostly stable.
> If all goes well the next step is the release candidate!
>
> If you have a little bit of time on your hands, you can try to fix one of our
> [newcomers issues](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/fractal/-/issues/?label_name%5B%5D=4.%20Newcomers).
> Anyone can make Fractal better!

### Element X iOS ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios))

A total rewrite of Element-iOS using the Matrix Rust SDK underneath and targeting devices running iOS 16+.

[Doug](https://matrix.to/#/@douge:matrix.org) reports

> * This week brings the Release Candidate for v1.8.4 to TestFlight which amongst other things enables Message Pinning -
>   long press on a message and tap Pin to try it out yourself!
> * v1.8.4 is also our first build to use Xcode 16 which should fix some iOS 18-related bugs and
>   we’ve been fixing any smaller bugs that we’ve encountered as the week has progressed.
> * Lots of time has been spent on our tests (some of which fell apart a little after the Xcode 16 upgrade),
>   and hopefully we’ll soon be back to enjoying a stable suite of tests.
> * Finally we’re tackling the big AGPL migration and are updating Element iOS Classic,
>   Compound iOS and the Rich Text Editor to be inline with all of our Element licenses.

### Element X Android ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-android))

Android Matrix messenger application using the Matrix Rust SDK and Jetpack Compose.

[ganfra](https://matrix.to/#/@ganfra:matrix.org) reports

> * This week we've released version 0.6.4 to Google Play Open Testing.
> Message Pinning is now stable - long press on a message and tap Pin to try it out yourself!
> * We have spend most of our time fixing bugs and improving code, including tests.
> * Finally we’re tackling the AGPL migration on various projects to be inline with all of our Element licenses.

### etke.cc ([website](https://etke.cc))

Your matrix server on your conditions

[Aine [don't DM]](https://matrix.to/#/@aine:etke.cc) says

> A while back,
> we at [etke.cc announced our Synapse-Admin fork](https://etke.cc/news/xueua5a7nvgjzxldyu52gkw7viftcthp8cz-m3dyi_8/?utm_source=twim&utm_medium=matrix&utm_campaign=synapse-admin),
> and this week we're excited to share two major updates:
>
> * **Upgrade to React Admin v5**
> * **Restrictions on modifying specific users**
>
> The React Admin upgrade enhances the Synapse-Admin UI experience, especially if you found the previous dark theme too high-contrast.
>
> The second update is a quality-of-life improvement you've always wanted but may not have known you needed. 🙂
>
> Previously, we introduced a feature to prevent users from accidentally deleting their sole homeserver administrator account.
>
> Now, we're addressing another common issue:
> inadvertently altering system user accounts managed by appservices (such as bridges and bots).
> Editing, deleting, locking, or changing the passwords of these appservice-managed accounts can cause serious problems.
> To prevent this, we've added a new feature that blocks these types of modifications to such accounts,
> while still allowing other risk-free changes (changing display names and avatars).
> By defining a list of MXID regex patterns in the new `asManagedUsers` configuration setting,
> you can protect these accounts from accidental changes.
>
> If you're using [matrix-docker-ansible-deploy](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/),
> the playbook automatically handles this configuration setting to ensure appservice-managed user accounts remain safe.

### AlexGames: simple Lua/Rust WebAssembly powered board games running in a Matrix widget

[axby](https://matrix.to/#/@axby:matrix.org) announces

> I put together a collection of simple board games written in Lua and Rust, built them to WebAssembly,
> and focused on a standalone web application that relies on a websocket server for multiplayer.
> I tried swapping out the websocket server for the Matrix widget API, and it works!
> This means that all you need is the static HTML/JS/WASM hosted on a server,
> and you can add a widget to a small Matrix room like this:
>
> `/addwidget https://alexbarry.net/dev/games/matrix-widget/?matrix_widget_id=$matrix_widget_id&matrix_user_id=$matrix_user_id`
>
> And you can play games with a friend, using Element web or desktop. No other server side handling required!
>
> Here's a demo video, two Element web sessions playing chess together, using the Matrix room for game state changes: <https://youtu.be/a_uR0tPeR18?t=15>
>
> Source code is [available in a branch on GitHub here](https://github.com/alexbarry/AlexGames/tree/matrix-widget),
> and feel free to join [#alexgames:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#alexgames:matrix.org) if you're interested in more,
> or want to find someone to try a game with.
> To try the standalone web version, you can visit <https://alexbarry.github.io/AlexGames/> .
> I'd be happy to update and polish the Matrix widget version if there's interest.
> I also set up my project so that you could write your own games in Lua and upload them
> to the existing web/matrix version, without having to build the project.
> See my [very simple API](https://alexbarry.github.io/AlexGames/game_api_doc.html)
> (e.g. `draw_rectangle`, `handle_user_clicked`) and the [API demo example game](https://github.com/alexbarry/AlexGames/tree/main/src/lua_scripts/games/api_demo).
