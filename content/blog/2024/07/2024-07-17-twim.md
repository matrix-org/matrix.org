## Dept of Spec üìú

[Andrew Morgan (anoa) {he/him}](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io) says

> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <https://spec.matrix.org/proposals>.
>
>
> ### MSC Status
>
> **New MSCs:**
>
> - [MSC4170: 403 error responses for profile APIs](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4170)
> - [MSC4169: Backwards-compatible redaction sending using `/send`](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4169)
> - [MSC4168: Update `m.space.*` state on room upgrade](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4168)
> - [MSC4167: Copy bans on room upgrade](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4167)
> - [MSC4166: Specify `/turnServer` response when no TURN servers are available](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4166)
> - [MSC4165: Remove own power level on deactivation](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4165)
> - [MSC4164: Leave all rooms on deactivation](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4164)
> - [MSC4163: Make ACLs apply to EDUs](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4163)
>
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
>
> - [MSC1840: Typed rooms](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1840) (close)
>
> **Accepted MSCs:**
>
> - [MSC4159: Remove the deprecated name attribute on HTML anchor elements](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4159)
>
> **Closed MSCs:**
>
> - *No MSCs were closed/rejected this week.*
>
> ## Spec Updates
>
> Lots of new MSCs this week - thank you to everyone proposing new ideas or clarifications to the spec!
>
> We have just one MSC this week from the Tuesday pings. Get it below.
>
> - [MSC3572: Relation aggregation cleanup](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3572) (disposition: close)
>     - Since this MSC was written, it has been shown that having (unstable) prefixes in the `unsigned` field of events is useful. Hence the general consensus from the SCT has been to close this MSC as it stands.
>     - Needs 1 checkmark from the SCT (started the week needing 2).

## Dept of VoIP ü§ô

[Andrew F](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewf:element.io) announces

### VoIP call membership reliability

> The VoIP team is hard at work finalizing the foundations of **MatrixRTC**. The current main topic is **"reliable call member state"**, which has many different possible solutions and is very important to get right.
>
> We've been making progress, and this week we can share a demo of the first implementation of reliable state, shown in the video below this post.
>
> Here's an explanation of the demo:
>
>     - Two users join a call, and each users' client sends a state event to communicate its membership in that call. The room state is used to render the call participant count.
>
> - Then, one of the users forcefully closes its Element Call tab, and cannot send anything to the homeserver anymore.
> - But, in just a few seconds, the other user sees the call participant count drop. This means the room state was "magically" updated even though the client of the user who left is disconnected!
>
> Why this is so important and how this is achieved can be found in the Matrix Live video of this week (at the top of this TWIM entry).
>
> For the technical details on how the demo works, see [MSC4140](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4140) for the basis of its implementation of the participant count cleanup.
> {{figureVideo(vid="/blog/img/d69a43a600530d78b3d40b6f86fd243e1c593ac11811820576617005056.mp4",caption="A demo of two users doing a voice call")}}

Matrix server setup using Ansible and Docker

[Slavi](https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com) announces

> [matrix-docker-ansible-deploy](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy) has upgraded its default reverse-proxy server Traefik to the recently released version 3. See [this blog post](https://traefik.io/blog/announcing-traefik-proxy-v3-rc/) to learn about its new features.
>
> Since [HTTP/3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/3) support is no longer considered experimental in Traefik v3, the playbook now enables it by default.
