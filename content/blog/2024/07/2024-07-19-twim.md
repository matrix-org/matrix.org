## Dept of Spec üìú

[Andrew Morgan (anoa) {he/him}](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io) says

> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <https://spec.matrix.org/proposals>
> 
> 
> ### MSC Status
> 
> **New MSCs:**
> * [MSC4171: Service members](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4171)
> 
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
> * *No MSCs are in FCP.*
> 
> **Accepted MSCs:**
> * [MSC3572: Relation aggregation cleanup](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3572)
> * [MSC1840: Typed rooms](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1840)
> 
> **Closed MSCs:**
> * *No MSCs were closed/rejected this week.*
> 
> ### Spec Updates
> 
> We have just one MSC this week from the Tuesday pings. Get it below.
> 
> * [MSC4163: Make ACLs apply to EDUs](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4163) (merge)
>     * There is one outstanding concern on this MSC for improved clarity, however the author appears to have already addressed this point. Looks like it's only a matter of time before FCP beigns on this one.
>     * Requires **1 more** tick from the SCT (Started the week needing 6)
>     
> Once again, thank you to everyone who is writing PRs against [matrix-spec](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec), especially [Johennes](https://github.com/Johennes) and [Kladki](https://github.com/Kladki) who combined have had lots of PRs (and MSCs!) created and merged recently. Cheers!

## Dept of Servers üè¢

### Synapse ([website](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/))

Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by Element

[Andrew Morgan (anoa) {he/him}](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io) announces

> This week we released [Synapse v1.111.0](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/releases/tag/v1.111.0) (v36? ü§ñ) and with it came increased support for [Authenticated Media](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/blob/main/proposals/3916-authentication-for-media.md) and [native Sliding Sync](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3575). Again, please note that native sliding sync is still experimental, and we do not (yet) advise trying it yet unless you're a developer. Finally, with the additional authenticated media endpoints in place, Synapse now declares support for [Matrix v1.11](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.11/) to clients.
> 
> Other changes include forcing deactivated users to forget all rooms they were in (which was preventing [garbage collection of rooms](https://element-hq.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/configuration/config_documentation.html#forgotten_room_retention_period) they were in) and improved support for OIDC with an experimental implementation of [MSC3861: delegate authentication via OIDC](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3861).
> 
> See the [full changelog](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/releases/tag/v1.111.0) for all the details.

## Dept of Clients üì±

### Fractal ([website](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal))

Matrix messaging app for GNOME written in Rust.

[K√©vin Commaille](https://matrix.to/#/@zecakeh:tedomum.net) reports

> Did you miss us? Only two weeks after our beta release, we are ready to release Fractal 8.rc.
> 
> Here are the main goodies since Fractal 8.beta:
> 
> * Draft messages are persisted in the database, allowing to restore them after a restart
> * A banner appears when synchronization with the homeserver fails too many times in a row
> * Links in room descriptions are detected in most places
> * Collapsed categories in the sidebar are remembered between restarts, with the ‚ÄúHistorical‚Äù category collapsed by default
> * The history media viewers show properly when they are loading or empty
> 
> As usual, this release includes other improvements, fixes and new translations thanks to all our contributors, and our upstream projects.
> 
> It is available to install via Flathub Beta, see the [instructions in our README](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/fractal#installation-instructions).
> 
> As the version implies, it should be mostly stable and we expect to only include minor improvements until the release of Fractal 8.
> 
> If you want to spend your summer or winter coding, solving our [issues](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/fractal/-/issues) is a great place to start!

### FluffyChat ([website](https://fluffychat.im))

The cutest instant messenger in the [matrix].

[Krille-chan](https://matrix.to/#/@krille:janian.de) announces

> FluffyChat v1.21.2 has been released üöÄ and is right now available in all AppStore (except F-Droid). This release brings several üêû bug fixes and a üö® security fix.
> 
> Rooms without a known last message are no longer jumping around in the room list and the last message in the room list now also decrypts when keys are coming afterwards.
> 
> Also a (security related) bug, where the app tried to load images from arbitrary urls, has been fixed.
> Therefore I encourage all users to install the update.
> If you are using a fork, please check if it is also affected.

### Element X iOS ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios))

## Dept of VoIP ü§ô

### Element Call ([website](https://call.element.io))

Native Decentralised End-to-end Encrypted Group Calls in Matrix, as a standalone web app

[Timo K.](https://matrix.to/#/@toger5:matrix.org) says

> This week, the Element VoIP team presents a new release. (Just a small one for now)
> 
> Release version v0.5.18
> 
> v0.5.18 has fixes that users get "magically" muted.
> Since real magic does not exist, there is an explanation to it:
> Whenever a call has 8 or more participants, we want the default to be that the microphone is muted.
> This condition was reactive, but now this only happens once at the start of a call.
> The much bigger change in this release (and one of the big achievements this week) is that
> Element Call v0.5.18 supports the new event format from MSC4143 (MatrixRTC), which allows us to implement reliable call memberships
> So updating to this version will be the minimal requirement to be compatible with MSC4143 (MatrixRTC).
> It is still using the old format from MSC3401 by default. Only if it is configured to use the new version in the
> config, or if someone else is using the new version v0.5.18, it will also send the new event format.
> This is an exciting milestone where the first part of reliable call memberships reach production.
> The new layout is testable?
> For all of you that don't like small preparation steps but want to see and feel how things evolve, there is even more exciting news.
> We merged a big project into the dev branch of element call: call.element.dev.
> All the UI logic was refactored and allows for elegant rxjs (reactive programming using Observables) code.
> It is easy and elegant to create new layouts based on the new architecture, and writing tests for this code is much easier thanks
> to the introduction of an MVVM architecture.
> So be invited to play around with call.element.dev. We just reached the point where it is fully usable, fast and fun.
> Even though we are not yet feature complete, it already feels more snappy and fixes a couple of long awaited issues like everybody's all time favorite: Spotlight layout is still jumpy and erratic

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks üß∞

[tulir](https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net) announces

> All mautrix-* bridges and libraries as well as gomuks have been updated to support Matrix v1.11 authenticated media <https://mau.fi/blog/2024-07-mautrix-release/>

### Elm SDK ([website](https://github.com/noordstar/elm-matrix-sdk))

A more consistent alternative to the matrix-js-sdk, written in Elm.

[Bram](https://matrix.to/#/@bram:matrix.directory) announces

> This week, beta 3.4.0 has been released, which introduces the `/sync` implementation. This is massive, because it means that **this Elm SDK version has the minimum necessary features to build a functional Matrix client!** üéâüéâüéâ Expect clients with zero runtime errors soon.
> 
> If you're unfamiliar with Elm, stay tuned, because Elm is interoperable with JavaScript. I'm talking to a few friends of mine who might help me turn the Elm SDK into a capable competitor to the existing matrix-js-sdk. For now, however, the focus is to add all the other features you'd expect from an SDK.

## Dept of Bots ü§ñ

### [maubot/reactbot](https://github.com/maubot/reactbot) challenge!

[HarHarLinks](https://matrix.to/#/@kim:sosnowkadub.de) reports

> Hi TWIM! üëã
> I generally like to have fun, and one of the things that I enjoy is solving puzzles. Also, I like Matrix, and some of you might know that I am an avid collector of Matrix powered gadgets that might be useful, ~~annoying the users in my rooms~~ fun, somewhere in between, or maybe even both! In fact, I'm planning to show off some of that [at The Matrix Conference](https://cfp.matrix.org/matrixconf2024/talk/F9ZKSV/) in 2 months. In the meantime, I thought maybe you too like fun, so let's do something in the meantime! Which leads me to **the [maubot/reactbot](https://github.com/maubot/reactbot) challenge**!
> 
> In case you have been living under a rock and are somehow not aware, [maubot](https://mau.bot/) is a wonderful plugin-powered bot framework for Matrix. There is a popular plugin called reactbot that essentially does what you'd expect based on its name: It will read any message sent into a room and react to it according to some rules that you configure for it. We even have an instance running in this here [#thisweekinmatrix:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#thisweekinmatrix:matrix.org) room (hiiii Cookie Bot!! üç™‚ù§Ô∏è)!
> 
> The rules to configure the reactbot are somewhat limiting at first look but actually very flexible and allow you to create some of your own simple Matrix bot by writing YAML and perhaps regex instead of real code‚Ñ¢Ô∏è! Let's ignore whether this is a good thing, and look at some examples instead: at <https://github.com/maubot/reactbot/tree/master/samples> you can find some absolute essentials like explanations about FOSS software as well as less serious stuff like sending threaded messages to troll users without thread aware clients.
> 
> I've blabbered on enough, so here goes: I challenge you to **submit** your fun/crazy/weird/amazing reactbots (i.e. config snippets) as code blocks **via the Matrix room [#reactbot-challenge:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#reactbot-challenge:matrix.org)** so everyone can check them out and vote on the most fun/crazy/weird/amazing/best one! Here is a simple one of mine as an example to start turning the gears in your heads:
> ```
> templates:
>     reaction:
>         type: m.reaction
>         variables:
>             react_to_event: '{{event.content.get_edit() or event.event_id}}'
>         content:
>             m.relates_to:
>                 rel_type: m.annotation
>                 event_id: $${react_to_event}
>                 key: $${reaction}
> 
> rules:
>     schnapszahl:
>         matches:
>         - ^(?:.*[^0-9.,])?([0-9])(?:[.,]?\1)+(?:[^0-9.,].*)?$
>         template: reaction
>         variables:
>             reaction: ü•Éüî¢
> ```
> It will react with "ü•Éüî¢" to any repdigit, which in German we call [Schnapszahl](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/De-Schnapszahl.ogg) (schnapps number).
