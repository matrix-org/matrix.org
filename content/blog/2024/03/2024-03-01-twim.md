## Dept of *Status of Matrix* 🌡️

[Josh Simmons](https://matrix.to/#/@josh:josh.tel) announces

> This week Thib published the second installment in our roadmap blog post series: [Opening up the Foundation](/blog/2024/02/opening-up-foundation/). This post dives into the work we’re doing this year to increase community participation and open governance, looking even beyond the Governing Board to things like office hours, working groups, and fiscal sponsorship.
>
> If you missed the first post in the series, check it out: [A roadmap and appeal for help from The Matrix.org Foundation](/blog/2024/01/2024-roadmap-and-fundraiser/).
>
> We’re grateful for the level of [support we’ve received](/support/) as we share more about the Foundation’s financial needs and the work we are doing in service of the ecosystem. Many dozens of individuals have donated and joined as Individual Members, and we’ve more than doubled the number of organizational members! Huge thanks to Beeper, Fairkom, Famedly, Fractal Networks, Gematik, IndieHosters, and XWiki.
>
> We still have a long way to go, and critically [we need larger organizations to step up to the plate](/membership/), but the early results are encouraging. Onwards and upwards! 🚀

[Matthew](https://matrix.to/#/@matthew:matrix.org) reports

> There's a huge number of Matrix projects active in the German public sector, and the team at Element has had a go at mapping them out and providing a guide to what's going on, how they relate to each other, and to generally try to explain why Germany is the leading country for digital sovereignty - including self-sovereign secure communication with Matrix: <https://element.io/matrix-in-germany>

## Dept of Spec 📜

[Andrew Morgan  (anoa)](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io) says

> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <https://spec.matrix.org/proposals>.
>
>
> ### MSC Status
>
> **New MSCs:**
>
> * [MSC4115: membership information on events](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4115)
> * [MSC4114: Matrix as a password manager](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4114)
> * [MSC4113: Image hashes in Policy Lists](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4113)
>
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
>
> * *No MSCs are in FCP.*
>
> **Accepted MSCs:**
>
> * [MSC4077: Improved process for handling deprecated HTML features](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4077)
>
> **Closed MSCs:**
>
> * *No MSCs were closed/rejected this week.*
>
> ### Spec Update
>
> Once again, a general call for help for folks to write up some spec PRs - aka turning our [current list of accepted MSCs](https://github.com/orgs/matrix-org/projects/31#column-19200628) into actual PR against the spec itself.
>
> Huge thanks to [@zecakeh](https://github.com/zecakeh) for writing several of these over the past week. The number left is dropping rapidly! Likewise to others that have been sending general fixes and updates to the spec as well.
>
> If that sounds like something you'd like to help out with, even if you've never touched the spec before, please consider writing one up! You can see examples of Spec PRs here, and can join [#matrix-docs:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-docs:matrix.org) for help 🙂
>
> ### Random MSC of the Week
>
> The random MSC of the week is... [MSC2872: Move the widget title to the top level of the definition](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2872)!
>
> This is a very simple maintenance MSC which moves the "title" property from within the "data" property to the top-level of a widget definition (a `m.widget` state event). The reasoning is simply that the "name" property is also top-level in the widget definition, and it makes sense to put those by each other.

### Neochat ([website](https://invent.kde.org/network/neochat))

A client for matrix, the decentralized communication protocol

[Tobias Fella](https://matrix.to/#/@tobiasfella:kde.org) reports

> ## NeoChat 24.02 was released
>
> This week, we have released version 24.02 of NeoChat. On a technical side, the most notable change is the migration from Qt5 to Qt6, though as an end user, you shouldn't notice a significant difference here. On the feature side, this release brings massively improved support for spaces and in-app account registration and deactivation. It also brings support  for showing reactions based on custom emojis, for receiving push notifications using KUnifiedPush (not enabled by default, for now), and for forwarding messages to other rooms. You can now also quickly share contacts with other users by showing a QR code linking people's matrix ID. We have fixed ~~my favorite~~ the most annoying bug NeoChat has, where NeoChat would load forever if it fails to connect to your account, and finally, we have implemented the most requested feature: being able to switch to a dark mode when running on Android. But that's not all! There's also a ton of other improvements, fixes, and features - far too many to list here.
>
> The release will be out very soon on Flathub. If your distro doesn't have it yet, it probably will, some time soon. ~~If it doesn't, go bother them about it :)~~. The windows store should also receive the update in the near future.
>
> ## What's next?
>
> Since the release, we haven't been idle, of course.
> Notable features merged since the last update include:
>
> * The possibility to sort the room list alphabetically (Implemented by James)
> * Improvements to message rendering, most notably with amazing syntax highlighting for code blocks (also implemented by James)
> * Improvements to the developer tools, like showing account data and a nicer list for state events (implemented by me, Tobias)
> * Fixed sharing with Plasma's Purpose system (implemented by me)
> * Audio and Video messages now stopping when a different message starts playing (implemented by me)
>
> Still under review are support for sharing messages to other applications using [Purpose](https://invent.kde.org/frameworks/purpose) and a built-in QR code scanner for scanning contact info, room links, etc.
> Finally, as a sneak peak into the future: We might also currently be experimenting with LiveKit based video calls 🤫

### Element X iOS ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios))

A total rewrite of Element-iOS using the Matrix Rust SDK underneath and targeting devices running iOS 16+.

[Ștefan](https://matrix.to/#/@stefan.ceriu:matrix.org) announces

> Happy [Mărțișor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%83r%C8%9Bi%C8%99or) day, everybody! 💐
>
> Element X `1.5.10` has been submitted to AppStore review and improves how your homeserver identifies the latest iPhones and Mac and makes errors more helpful when first configuring a homeserver. Plus tapping on your avatar in the Home Screen will go straight to the settings screen.
>
> See the full release notes here: <https://github.com/element-hq/element-x-ios/releases/tag/1.5.9>
>
> We're also making good progress on new features:
>
> * [Kicking and banning members](https://github.com/element-hq/element-x-ios/pull/2501)
> * [Managing blocked users](https://github.com/element-hq/element-x-ios/pull/2504)

### Element X Android ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-android))

Android Matrix messenger application using the Matrix Rust Sdk and Jetpack Compose

[benoit](https://matrix.to/#/@benoit.marty:matrix.org) announces

> The version 0.4.5 has been published on the testing track. Changelog: <https://github.com/element-hq/element-x-android/releases/tag/v0.4.5>. Among new things: mark rooms as favorite, add some moderation tool to rooms (still not 100% implemented), add a gesture to swipe to dismiss the media viewer.
>
> Now the team is working on moderation actions like banning members, blocking / unblocking people. We are also improving the overall quality of the translations. And we have started to work on login using QR code, for a very fast way to log in a device using an existing session, which will also take care of accessing the message history without any other user actions.
>
> We are also iterating on the room list filtering, which will be soon available on production.

## Dept of VoIP 🤙

### MatrixRTC calls

[Timo K.](https://matrix.to/#/@toger5:matrix.org) says

> Hello from the VoIP team,
> with matrixRTC recently reaching the point where [there are multiple clients supporting it](https://matrix.org/blog/2024/01/26/this-week-in-matrix-2024-01-26/#continue-reading). There is lots of momentum and motivation to make it well integrated and joyful to use.
>
> ## Embedding
>
> Lot of work happened on improving and finalizing the embedding of element call into element web.
> We want it to be seamless and stable.
> Some of the more visible changes of the last weeks are:
>
> * EC will now use the same theme as EW and thanks to compound we already have a decent looking light theme for Element Call.
> * There is a new hidden feature to skip the lobby by pressing the **shift key while clicking** on any of the call buttons.
> * In embedded mode element call is now using the same compound themed lobby that is also used in the stand alone app.
>
> We are getting closer and closer to make matrixRTC calls the new standard.
>
> ## External conference links
>
> Besides the integration work we are building a way to invite external non-matrix users into a call.
> In the future it should be possible to start a call in Element Web, create a link to that call and share that link. This url will
> bring non matrix users to an instance of the Element Call single page application where they get a temporal matrix account and seamlessly
> join the conference. (This is already working in an mvp fashion, Feel invited to watch the demo in this weeks matrix live)
>
> Another small addition which might be hard to find, hence is worth mentioning, is that one can now change if a video is rendered as "Fit to Frame" (cropped) or without cropping which is very useful if someone is using a portrait video feed. (see the light themed screenshot)
>
> For anyone eager to try calls over matrixRTC themselves, it is currently supported on EX and [develop.element.io](https://develop.element.io) (If "new group call experience" is activated in the labs settings)

### Draupnir4All

[MTRNord](https://matrix.to/#/@mtrnord:midnightthoughts.space) announces

> Small update on the project today: We updated <https://docs.draupnir.midnightthoughts.space> to a more readable design and hopefully also better working for mobile than before. If you have any issues please report them at <https://github.com/the-draupnir-project/draupnir4all_docs> :)
>
> Also while I was at it I added S/MIME and PGP keys to my Zammad instance that's used for the email. You can find the public keys/certs at <https://docs.draupnir.midnightthoughts.space/getting-started.html#pgp-and-smime> as well as the fingerprints of each file. Sending both just signed or encrypted files should be possible with both. Encrypted Replies are only confirmed working with PGP at this time. This is somewhat complicated by the Zammad integration for now. However, all messages will be signed by either GPG or SMIME.
