Hey all,

[Matrix 1.10](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.10/) is here! We aim to release the specification once in each calendar quarter, and with Q1 wrapping up in a few days we’re due for this quarter’s release. It has been 5 months since the last release ([Matrix 1.9](https://matrix.org/blog/2023/11/29/matrix-v1.9-release/)) brought in some protocol maintenance for us though, and the implementation teams have been hard at work building the [Matrix 2.0 stack](https://matrix.org/blog/2023/09/matrix-2-0/) concurrent to the Matrix 1.10 work released today.

A total of 9 MSCs are released in Matrix 1.10, covering a wide range of maintenance, Matrix 2.0 preparation, and features for clients to use. This post focuses a bit on the Matrix 2.0 front and what’s expected in Matrix 1.11’s release cycle, but read on to the changelog at the bottom for full details on the changes which make up Matrix 1.10.


## MSC3077: Multi-stream VoIP

[MSC3077](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/blob/main/proposals/3077-multi-stream-voip.md) and its related proposal [MSC3291](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/blob/main/proposals/3291-muting.md) (muting in VoIP calls) lay some foundational groundwork for proper group VoIP to land in Matrix - an objective of Matrix 2.0. Currently this is taking shape at [MSC3898](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3898) and [MSC3401](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3401), though Element’s VoIP team is considering a possible third alternative which runs [MSC3401](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3401) over something like LiveKit’s SFU - stay tuned for updates there. In the meantime, users in native 1:1 calls can enjoy proper screen sharing and mute capabilities ahead of the 1:N call support later this year.

As always, early review is appreciated though please note that [MSC3898](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3898) and [MSC3401](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3401) are particularly in flux at the moment.


## Up next in Matrix 1.11 and beyond

Over the next 2-3 months, we’ll be focusing on the following MSCs:



* Trust & Safety improvements (at the protocol level).
    * [MSC3823](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/issues/3823) - Account suspension
    * [MSC3939](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/issues/3939) - Account locking
    * [MSC3916](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/issues/3916) - Authentication for media (time permitting)
    * [MSC4117](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/issues/4117) - Reversible redactions (pre-implementation review)
    * MSCs around a “reporting v2” flow in light of various legislation and compliance requirements. These MSCs are currently being written and should be up for pre-implementation review within the Matrix 1.11 cycle.
* Early review of Matrix 2.0 features as they become ready.
    * Sliding sync ([MSC3575](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3575)) + applicable extensions.
    * Group VoIP - Exact MSCs to be determined, as they may change following implementation.
    * OIDC Authentication - Exact MSCs to be determined.
* Pre-implementation review of [Extensible Events](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/blob/main/proposals/1767-extensible-events.md) core content blocks MSCs.
    * Many of these MSCs require updates before they are ready for formal review.
    * [MSC3954](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3954) - Emotes
    * [MSC3955](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3955) - Notices / automated events
    * [MSC3927](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3927) - Audio
    * [MSC3551](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3551) - Files
    * [MSC3552](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3552) - Images and Stickers
    * [MSC3553](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3553) - Videos

Additionally, we’ll be continuing to define the expectations of a Spec Core Team member, particularly as it relates to the upcoming Governing Board for the Foundation. This exercise has been extremely valuable to us so far, and will help identify areas the Foundation and SCT may need support from each other.
