## Dept of Spec 📜

### Authenticated Media

[TravisR](https://matrix.to/#/@travis:t2l.io) says

> Progress on authenticated media continues! As of today, beta.matrix.org has now frozen its media to allow client and server developers, as well as homeserver owners, to test how their stuff responds when a media freeze is in place. This milestone brings us one step closer to matrix.org itself freezing unauthenticated media, described in more detail on the blog: <https://matrix.org/blog/2024/06/26/sunsetting-unauthenticated-media/>
>
> The happy path for interacting with beta.matrix.org _should_ be:
>
> 1. Log in or register a new account
> 2. Note that media from before today (August 7th) loaded fine
> 3. Upload something new
> 4. Still loads fine (including over federation)
>
> If you run into issues or bugs, let us know in the [#matrix-client-developers:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-client-developers:matrix.org) or [#homeservers-dev:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#homeservers-dev:matrix.org) rooms on Matrix. We're around to help make this as smooth of a transition as possible!

### Weekly spec update

> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <https://spec.matrix.org/proposals>.
>
> **New MSCs:**
>
> - [MSC4175: Profile field for user time zone](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4175)
>
> MSCs in Final Comment Period:
>
> _No new MSCs entered FCP this week._
>
> **Accepted MSCs:**
>
> - [MSC4163: Make ACLs apply to EDUs](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4163)
>
> **Closed MSCs:**
>
> _No MSCs were closed this week._
>
> **Spec Updates**
>
> If you are a client or homeserver developer, make sure you read up on the upcoming authenticated media!
>
> Apart from that the spec team has been busy combing through the general spec backlog. Identifying MSCs which appear stuck waiting for SCT input is particularly helpful - drop some links in [Office of the Matrix Spec Core Team](https://matrix.to/#/%23sct-office%3Amatrix.org) with a description of how it appears stuck.

## Dept of Bridges 🌉

### mautrix-manager

[tulir](https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net) reports

> I made a helper app for logging into bridges: <https://mau.fi/blog/introducing-mautrix-manager/> / <https://github.com/mautrix/manager>. Thanks to the new generic bridge login APIs, it can be used to log into any megabridge without having to build support into the app for each bridge. It should be particularly useful for networks where logging in requires extracting cookies, as it can simply open a webview and automatically extract cookies rather than requiring the user to mess with browser devtools.

## Dept of Clients 📱

### Extera

[OfficialDakari](https://matrix.to/#/@me:officialdakari.ru) reports

> During this week, we worked on some new feature for Extera. A new feature was added: Calls.
>
> Yes, Extera now supports 1-to-1 **only voice** calls. You can now make outgoing and accept/reject ingoing calls.
>
> Video and group calls are going to be implemented later.

### kazv ([website](https://kazv.chat/))

kazv is a convergent matrix client and instant messaging app.

[nannanko](https://matrix.to/#/@nannanko:tusooa.xyz) says

> [kazv v0.5.0](https://kazv.chat/en/release-notes/kazv/v0.5.0/) relies on libkazv v0.7.0, which has an important security fix for encrypted attachments. It also adds a lot of features like hard logout, viewing event edit history, an emoji picker in the reaction dialog, setting your own display name in a room (/myroomnick, but using just a text box instead of slash commands), and a lot of style fixes for Qt6/KF6. Video playing is also enhanced. Note that this version only supports Qt6/KF6.

### Element X iOS ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios))

A total rewrite of Element-iOS using the Matrix Rust SDK underneath and targeting devices running iOS 16+.

[Doug](https://matrix.to/#/@douge:matrix.org) reports

> - Identity Reset is complete and will be available in the next release.
> - Encryption warnings are built and currently behind a feature flag.
> - Message pinning is progressing nicely, with the banner complete and the new timeline underway.
> - Plenty of bugs related to Calls have been fixed.
> - Third-party library Acknowledgements have been added in the system’s Settings app.

### Element X Android ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-android))

Android Matrix messenger application using the Matrix Rust SDK and Jetpack Compose.

[Jorge](https://matrix.to/#/@jorgem:element.io) announces

> This week has been focused mainly on progressing on message pinning and improving the way we load data so it's faster and more efficient:
>
> - With the right feature flag enabled you can start testing the message pinning feature, pin and unpin events and see which events are pinned in a room.
> - Sync on push has been enabled by default. This will start a quick sync after a push notification is received and have the item cached so you can see the events in the timeline as you open the room.
> - Room subscriptions are now batched, which should make the room list load faster since it avoids canceling several outgoing requests as each new room was subscribed to.
> - Identity reset is also being worked on so you can reset your keys if you get stuck after logging into your account and don't have another device to verify your device against and no access to the recovery key either.

### Cinny v4.1.0 ([website](https://cinny.in))

Cinny is a Matrix client focused on simplicity, elegance and security

[Lozenge](https://matrix.to/#/@kfiven:matrix.org) reports

> This release add support for matrix.to links, back button for mobile view and fixes few bugs. For full changelog, checkout <https://github.com/cinnyapp/cinny/releases/tag/v4.1.0>
>
> - For feedback and help join Cinny space at [#cinny-space:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#cinny-space:matrix.org)

## Dept of Encryption 🔐

### Message Security in Matrix

[Sumner Evans](https://matrix.to/#/@sumner:nevarro.space) says

> I wrote an article about [Message Security in Matrix](https://sumnerevans.com/posts/matrix/megolm/) on my blog. The article describes Megolm, and explains what security guarantees it provides and how it provides them. It is written for an audience of people who are not cryptography experts but would like to understand the cryptographic guarantees Megolm provides.
>
> Here's a diagram of Megolm from the article. I break down everything in the diagram in the article! [Read it now!](https://sumnerevans.com/posts/matrix/megolm/)
>
> {{figure(img="<https://sumnerevans.com/posts/matrix/megolm/images/overview.png>", caption="Megolm Overview")}}

### C++ Binding for Vodozemac

[tusooa](https://matrix.to/#/@tusooa:tusooa.xyz) says

> We have a working cpp binding for vodozemac (<https://lily-is.land/kazv/vodozemac-bindings>) and have made some work to port libkazvcrypto from libolm to vodozemac (<https://iron.lily-is.land/T125>). We will also write a porting guide. Stay tuned for more information.

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰

### libkazv ([website](https://iron.lily-is.land/diffusion/L/))

libkazv is a matrix client sdk built upon lager and the value-oriented design it enables.

[nannanko](https://matrix.to/#/@nannanko:tusooa.xyz) announces

> [libkazv v0.7.0](https://kazv.chat/en/release-notes/libkazv/v0.7.0/) most importantly fixes a security bug in the attachment encryption that could potentially lead to a known-plaintext attack. See <https://iron.lily-is.land/D153> for more details.
>
> It also implements calculating local notifications and adds helper functions to pin and unpin events in a room. Documentation is also updated to reflect the current status of libkazv, and to add a introduction of the architecture of libkazv.

## Dept of Ops 🛠

### Synapse User Auto Eraser

[Aine](https://matrix.to/#/@aine:etke.cc) reports

> As part of [etke.cc migration to Github](https://github.com/etkecc), we needed a test repo to prepare automation and wiring, and so the Synapse User Auto Eraser was born 🎉
>
> It's a very simple app that deactivates (erases) synapse users and removes their media, that match the following criteria:
>
> - not an admin
> - not a guest
> - not deactivated
> - not contain a specific string in their MXID (configurable)
> - not older than a specific threshold in days (configurable)
>
> We use it to cleanup demo accounts automatically, but if you want to extend it to handle more cases - feel free to send PR 😉
>
> [Source code](https://github.com/etkecc/synapse-user-autoerase), [Docker images](https://github.com/orgs/etkecc/packages/container/package/synapse-user-autoerase), [Binary releases](https://github.com/etkecc/synapse-user-autoerase/releases)

## Dept of Bots 🤖

### YARB - Yet Another Reminder Bot

[Dominik ⚡️](https://matrix.to/#/@dominik:fuchss.org) reports

> [YARB](https://github.com/dfuchss/YARB) is a bot you can use to create reminders for specific times at the current day.
> It has been build using [Trixnity](https://trixnity.gitlab.io/trixnity/) and my [abstraction layer](https://github.com/dfuchss/matrix-bot-base) on top of it.
>
> #### Features
>
> - Create reminders for a specific time at the current day.
> - Configure an offset for the reminder time (-> the bot could remind you 3 minutes in advance)
> - Change display name per room
> - Change bot command name (you don't need to use _yarb_ as command 😉)
> - Simple rights management (same as for my other bots)
>
> {{figure(img="/blog/img/Phrn6vztiM5xaGasbTx4VursamcrWtfX.png",caption="A demo of using YARB to create a reminder at 15:40 using `!yarb 15:40 I'll remind you later🙂`")}}
>
> #### How to use the bot
>
> - After the bot has joined, use `!yarb help` to get an overview about the features of the bot (remember: the bot only respond to users)
> - In order to create a new reminder use `!yarb <time> <message>`. The time has to be in the format `HH:mm` (e.g., `!yarb 12:00 Lunch time!`).
>
> #### Development
>
> I'm typically online in the [#trixnity:imbitbu.de](https://matrix.to/#/#trixnity:imbitbu.de) channel. So feel free to tag me there if you have any questions. Also, feel free to test the bot and raise any issue using GitHub :)
