## Dept of *Status of Matrix* 🌡️

[TravisR](https://matrix.to/#/@travis:t2l.io) announces

> Something we're excited to see is several servers have already enacted their media freeze for unauthenticated media! Matrix.org is doing so on **Wednesday, September 4th, 2024** (just a few days away) during UK business hours. Other Synapse admins can enable this freeze on their servers by setting `enable_authenticated_media: True` in their `homeserver.yaml`. Admins using other server projects should consult their documentation, though please note that some projects are actively working on adding relevant support. 
> 
> For those interested in statistics, matrix.org is seeing about 80% of requests being authenticated so far. We anticipate this number will rise before Wednesday, but not significantly.

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰

### libQuotient ([website](https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient))

A Qt5 library to write cross-platform clients for Matrix

[kitsune](https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org) reports

> libQuotient 0.9 beta
>
> Looks like we did manage to shorten development cycles (not in the least thanks to NeoChat), and the first beta in the new cycle is already out - with authenticated media requests and generally Matrix 1.11 support, cross-signing, and lots of tweaks and cleanup, as usual. The full release notes are [in the usual place](https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/releases/tag/0.9-beta1); expect 0.9.0 to be released in time for the one and only [Matrix Conference](https://2024.matrix.org)!

## Dept of Bots 🤖

### nsfwbot Image Moderation Bot

[Tom Foster [he/him]](https://matrix.to/#/@tom:doctoruwu.uk) reports

> This is a basic moderation plugin for [Maubot](https://github.com/maubot/maubot?tab=readme-ov-file#maubot) to compare images against a freely available image model to decide if the images appear "Not Safe For Work" and take some action, such as redacting the post or notifying a moderation room. The model is very small (only around 25MB) and happily runs in very conservative CPU/RAM requirements.
> 
> It doesn't replace other moderation tooling, but could be invaluable in an admin's arsenal to help defend against unwanted spam in public rooms!
> 
> If you'd like to read more and give it a go for yourself, check out the [readme](https://github.com/tcpipuk/matrix-nsfwbot?tab=readme-ov-file#nsfwbot-for-matrix) and the [latest release](https://github.com/tcpipuk/matrix-nsfwbot/releases).

### communitybot maubot plugin

[wreck](https://matrix.to/#/@william:mssj.me) announces

> communitybot plugin for maubot updates! [repo](https://github.com/williamkray/maubot-communitybot)
> 
> the plugin has been updated with a couple new features: you can now leave unencrypted room creation as the default value, but pass `--encrypt` as part of the room name and it will be encrypted from the get-go, no extra steps!
> 
> also, there are some new message-redaction features. you can enable automated message redaction based on file uploads and/or a simple wordlist! this is brand new, and the regex is probably super greedy, so please test.

## Dept of Events and Talks 🗣️

### Matrix @ FrOSCon 2024

[Oleg](https://matrix.to/#/@oleg:fiksel.info) reports

> On the weekend from 17 to 18 of August the annual [**Fr**ee and **O**pen **S**ource **Con**ference (short FrOSCon)](https://froscon.org) took place in the university Sankt Augustin.
> 
> Like the years before [we](https://matrix.to/#/%23community-events%3Amatrix.org) represented Matrix with the Matrix Booth and the Matrix Devroom. Thanks to the support of the Matrix Foundation, we also were able to sell some official merch 👕 again. There has been a great deal of interest in Matrix! Especially from the the [younger community members](https://teckids.org). 🙂
> 
> We had also interesting talks and workshops in the Devroom (check out the schedule [Saturday](https://programm.froscon.org/2024/schedule/1.html#1) & [Sunday](https://programm.froscon.org/2024/schedule/2.html#1)) and even a [guest-talk from the XMPP Community about MIMI](https://programm.froscon.org/2024/events/3233.html)! It was really good to exchange with the XMPP community not only about technology and interoperability, but also project governance and organisational challenges. We look forward to increasing the collaboration with the XMPP community. Watch this space! 😉
> 
> In the downtime at the booth we ([Nico](https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev) & myself) hacked on the bot to connect a label printer to Matrix. Thanks for your help, [Nico](https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev)! 👍 Stay tuned 😁...
> 
> Unfortunately we didn't have the capacity to record the talks this year. Maybe next year someone will help us out with the recordings. 👀
> 
> We want to thank everyone involved in organizing this event! ❤️ It was a blast! 🚀
