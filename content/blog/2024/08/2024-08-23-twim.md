## Dept of *Status of Matrix* 🌡️

[Josh Simmons (he/they)](https://matrix.to/#/@josh:josh.tel) says

> The Foundation has updated its policy for accepting upstream contributions to our projects. We no longer require the use of "real" or "legal" names as part of the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developer_Certificate_of_Origin) (DCO). We thank the community members who reached out to let us know that our policy was a barrier for them, and we are excited to welcome contributions from people who were previously excluded.

### iamb ([website](https://github.com/ulyssa/iamb))

[ulyssa](https://matrix.to/#/@ulyssa:0x.badd.cafe) says

> I've released v0.0.10 of iamb! :tada: Since its last version, the client has gained:
>
> * Support for marking rooms as DMs, setting per-room notification levels, and message slash commands
> * Support for using the Kitty enhanced keyboard protocol (see [here](https://iamb.chat/terminals.html) for supported terminals)
> * Support for managing room canonical and alternative aliases, member kick/ban/unban, configuring room history
> * A command for viewing just unread rooms, and a subcommand to mark all rooms read at once.
> * Temporary files create with `:edit` now have a `.md` suffix so that `$EDITOR` can apply syntax highlighting.
> * Bug fixes for window resizes, `<C-W>o`, i686 builds, saving and restoring more layout information, and more!
>
> The [online documentation](https://iamb.chat/) has been updated, and you can head to [the GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/ulyssa/iamb/releases/tag/v0.0.10) for a full list of changes or to download binaries (including `.deb` and `.rpm` packages).
>
> Many thanks to all of those who have contributed to this release! 🙏

### Extera ([website](https://github.com/officialdakari/Extera))

[OfficialDakari](https://matrix.to/#/@me:officialdakari.ru) says

> During this week, we implemented some new features (and bugs too) into Extera.
>
> Here are some of them:
>
> * Sending captions in files
> * Reply fallbacks as option (disabled by default)
> * Improved bubble message layout
>
> Also we've started working on Android version of Extera and it will be available to download soon!

### Nheko ([website](https://nheko-reborn.github.io))

Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.

[Nico](https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev) announces

> Not too much exciting going on in the last few weeks, but I think there are 2 things worth sharing:
>
> Nheko now warns you, if you edit the room topic or room name of an encrypted room. Matrix does not encrypt state events and entering confidential information into the unencrypted room state might not be what you want to do, when you edit the room topic.
>
> Additionally we added a small feature to deal with spam of abusive images. You can now toggle in the Nheko settings, what media should be loaded by default. That way you can load all media by default (as before), never load media by default (and you have to click a button to load it on demand) or only load it by default in non-public rooms. Imo the latter provides a nice tradeoff, where your private rooms have all the media there by default, but in public rooms you get to decide, if you trust the sender. If someone sends a string of 5 images after joining, maybe don't load their media until someone tells you it is safe! ;-)

### Neochat ([website](https://invent.kde.org/network/neochat))

A client for matrix, the decentralized communication protocol

[Tobias Fella](https://matrix.to/#/@tobiasfella:kde.org) says

> This week, we have released version 24.08 of NeoChat 🎉
>
> Here are the highlights:
>
> * Cross-Signing: You can now verify other users and have their messages show up as verified. Similarly, your messages will show up as verified for other users after you have verified your own device.
> * Importing from Secret Backup: You can now importing the decryption keys for existing encrypted messages. The UI for this is still in a beta status, so it's a bit hidden. For now, you can enable the "Secret Backup" feature flag in NeoChat's developer tools and then opening the "Open Secret Backup" dialog from the menu that opens when right-clicking your user avatar in the lower-left corner of the window.
> * Importing and exporting encryption keys from / to a file
> * An option was added to automatically reject invitations from unknown accounts. You can enable this in the settings.
> * Notifications where overhauled significantly - now, you will only be notified for the newest message in a room, preventing very active rooms from flooding your notification center.
> * Many bugfixes and UI improvements

### Element X iOS ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios))

A total rewrite of Element-iOS using the Matrix Rust SDK underneath and targeting devices running iOS 16+.

[Mauro Romito](https://matrix.to/#/@mauro.romito:element.io) says

> * Implemented a timeline that shows only the currently pinned messages in a room, (if any) so that the user can easily check all the pinned messages at once
> * PiP support for Element Call has been implemented on El-X
> * Push notifications for events that are redacted will be removed from the notification center.
> * We now show message authenticity warnings in the timeline

## Dept of Services 🚀

### etke.cc ([website](https://etke.cc))

Your matrix server on your conditions

[Aine](https://matrix.to/#/@aine:etke.cc) reports

> At [etke.cc](https://etke.cc/) we've previously been using GitLab because other platforms lacked features we needed.
>
> It seems like GitHub has caught up and provides a better platform with a larger community of users.
>
> As such, we've migrated all of our GitLab repositories to GitHub. Most of our repositories were migrated to the new [etkecc](https://github.com/etkecc) organization, while non-Matrix-related Ansible roles (which were already used by the [MASH playbook](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook)) now live under the [MASH](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting) organization.
>
> There is a lot of housekeeping to do (e.g., updating various website links), but the migration part of the process is now complete.
>
> With this change, we hope to achieve improved collaboration on our FOSS projects!

## Dept of Events and Talks 🗣️

[Thib](https://matrix.to/#/@thibaultmartin:matrix.org) says
