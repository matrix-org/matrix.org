We imagined The Matrix Conference as a gathering place for hackers, project managers, digital sovereignty leaders, and innovators. I’m proud to announce that we definitely succeeded in building a schedule covering that range of topics!

We received more than 60 high-quality proposals and ended up building 5 tracks over the course of 2 “core” conference days. The tracks cover everything from sovereignty and collaboration in the public sector to digital rights, Matrix internals, the social impact of Matrix, and Matrix as the foundation for products.

The conference will occur between September 19th and 22nd at [Mitosis Labs in Berlin](https://2024.matrix.org/attend/#getting-there).

- **Thursday, 19, will be a BarCamp** starting at 10 a.m. local time. It’s an informal workshop-like day where attendees can join, pitch a topic they want to discuss and vote for topics they are interested in. In the evening, we will have a buffet at the venue.
- **The two core conference days are Friday, 20, and Saturday, 21.** The full schedule is [on the Matrix Conference Website](https://2024.matrix.org/schedule/).
- **Sunday 22** will be dedicated to sprints: sessions where the attendees can gather to work together on ideas that emerged during the conference in a more relaxed atmosphere.


We are particularly excited about the lineup of speakers:

- Josh Simmons will open the conference, leaving the floor to Matthew Hodgson for a talk about Matrix 2.0 coming together and shaping the future of Matrix.
- Julie Ripa from DINUM will walk us through the past, present and future of Tchap.
- Jan Kohnert will explain how Matrix has become the foundation for a key communication service within Germany’s healthcare sector.
- Marco Holz will tell us how FITKO and the German Federal Ministry of the Interior joined efforts to pilot a Matrix-based next-generation communication infrastructure for digital government services.
- Renato Stalder will share the details of SwissPost creating a secure, nationwide communication system based on Matrix.
- Carla Griggio will give us an academic and nuanced perspective on walled gardens.
- Pavel Zoneff from the Tor Project will explain how encryption is a cornerstone of advancing human rights worldwide.
