Hello everyone,

The Matrix.org Foundation is excited to host a Matrix.org Foundation and Community devroom in person next year again at [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2025/)! Half a day of talks, demos and workshops around Matrix itself and projects built on top of Matrix.

We encourage people working on the Matrix protocol or building on it in an open source project to submit a proposal! Note that companies are welcome to talk about the Matrix details of their open source projects, but marketing talks are not welcome.

<!-- more -->

## Key dates

- Conference dates: 1st and 2nd February, 2025
- Devroom date: 2nd February, 2025
- Submission deadline: Sunday, 1st December, 2024
- Announcement of selected talks: Friday, 15th December, 2024

You must be available in person [in Brussels](https://fosdem.org/2025/practical/transportation/) to present your talk.


## Talk Details

The talks can follow one of the two formats:

- 20 min talk + 10 min Q&A, for topics that can be covered briefly
- 50 min talk + 10 min Q&A, for more complex subjects which need more focus

We strongly encourage you to prepare a demo when it makes sense, so people can actually see what your work looks like in practice.

Of course, the proposal must respect the FOSDEM terms as well:

> The conference language is English. All content must relate to Free and Open Source Software. By participating in the event you agree to the publication of your recordings, slides and other content provided under the same licence as all FOSDEM content (CC-BY).


## Code of Conduct

All speakers and attendees agree that all of the presentations and discussions in our devroom are held under the guidelines set in the [FOSDEM Code of Conduct](https://fosdem.org/2025/practical/conduct/). We expect attendees, speakers, and volunteers to follow the CoC at all times.

If you have any questions about the CoC or wish to have one of the devroom organisers review your presentation slides or any other content for CoC compliance, please email us and we will do our best to assist you.


## Submitting a Proposal

Proposals must be submitted on FOSDEM's conference management system: <https://pretalx.fosdem.org/>. Heads up that last year FOSDEM shelved the good old Pentabarf in favour of Pretalx. All submissions must go through Pretalx: <https://pretalx.fosdem.org/fosdem-2025/cfp>. When submitting a proposal, make sure to select the Matrix.org Foundation & Community track.

We expect to receive more requests than we have slots available. The devroom organisers will be reviewing the proposals and accepting them based on the potential positive impact the project has on Matrix, as defined in the Mission section of <https://matrix.org/foundation>.

If a project proposal has been turned down, it doesn't mean we don't believe it has good potential. Maintainers are invited to join the [#twim:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#twim:matrix.org) Matrix room to give it some visibility.
