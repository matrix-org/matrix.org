## Jan 31 - Matrix Community Event

We organize an event before FOSDEM for the community to meet and talk about Matrix without fear of missing out on all the great talks at FOSDEM. The event will take place on January 31 at 1 pm CET at [HSBXL](https://hsbxl.be/) and last the whole afternoon. **Please note that HSBXL [moved since last year](https://hsbxl.be/enter).**

It's an [unconference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference)/[barcamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp): come and bring your ideas, share them at the beginning of the event, and small groups will form spontaneously.

Please note that the Matrix Community Event has [the same Health & Safety Policy as the Matrix Conference](https://2024.matrix.org/attend/#health-and-safety). Extremely briefly: You will need to wear a mask while indoors, except while eating and drinking.

As last year, attending the event is free, and we're looking for sponsors to show their commitment to the ecosystem by refreshing our community with drinks and feeding it with pizzas! Of course, you will be credited in our event wrap-up post on matrix.org. We're open to additional ideas to get you the recognition you deserve.

**Join [the FOSDEM Barcamp room](https://matrix.to/#/#fosdem-2025-barcamp:matrix.org) if you're interested in the event, and reach out to [events-wg@foundation.matrix.org](mailto:events-wg@foundation.matrix.org?subject=%5BFOSDEM%5D%20ORG_NAME%20wants%20to%20sponsor%20the%20barcamp) to sponsor!**

- üïêÔ∏è Friday 31, 13:00 - 21:00 CET (local time)

## Feb 1&2 - Booth

This year again, we are happy to have a booth for the duration of the event. This is our opportunity to talk with the broader open-source community, share our latest updates, and listen to people's feedback. We can also help the broader community spread the word with cool stickers and T-shirts!

We're looking for volunteers to run the booth with us. This includes talking to the community, sharing project news, and selling merch. Don't worry if it's your first time: We have a booth handbook ready for volunteers and want to limit the time commitment to 2 hours per day.

**Reach out to [events-wg@foundation.matrix.org](mailto:events-wg@foundation.matrix.org?subject=%5BFOSDEM%5D%20Volunteering%20for%20the%20booth) if you're interested in staffing the booth with us! We will work out together which slot works best for you. People who sign up before December 15 are entitled to a special edition T-shirt!**

## Feb 2 - Main Track Talk

Matthew's ["The Road to Mainstream Matrix" talk](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-6274-the-road-to-mainstream-matrix/) got accepted on the main track. It will happen right before the Devroom, fortunately in the same building!

- üïêÔ∏è Sunday 2, 12:00 - 12:50 CET (local time)
- üè¢ Room K.1.105 (La Fontaine)

## Feb 2 - DevRoom

Some topics are too complex to be discussed at a booth. Fortunately, we have a DevRoom on Sunday 2 afternoon to talk about topics in greater depth. Be it a technical talk about state resolution or a success story about how Matrix got deployed in your organization, we want to hear about it all!
