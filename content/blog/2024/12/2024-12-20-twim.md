### Community Year In Review 2024

[Nico](https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev) announces

> So, how was your year? NO! DON'T TELL ME NOW! But read on!
> 
> Some might remember the year in review for 2023 or 2022, well, this year is still 2024 and I decided to do another one!
> 
> If you don't remember, here is the gist of it: It is a room, where you can post about what you did, experienced or otherwise found interesting in 2024. You can also give some predictions for 2025, if you are so bold! Then, on the 31st, I will compose those into a blog post and you can read what others had to say! Now, the exact dates are a bit muddy, last time I was late and there is no guarantee I won't be late this time, but you have until the 30st to compose something you want to share.
> 
> There are no exact restrictions on what projects can participate or that what you share has to be a project, but we try to ring out the year with positive vibes from the community in general. Please also try to look at the overall year, if you just want to report on the week, well, there is something called "This Week in Matrix" for that!
> 
> Now, you probably are asking the important question, where is that room? Well, you can guess it from last years alias, but for everyone else:
> 
> Join [#year-in-2024:neko.dev](https://matrix.to/#/#year-in-2024:neko.dev)!
> 
> Have a good one, merry christmas and see you next year!

### New Gold Member

[Josh Simmons (m.org)](https://matrix.to/#/@joshsimmons:matrix.org) says

> Today we are thrilled to announce that [Automattic](https://automattic.com/) has joined the Foundation as a Gold Member! 🚀 Automattic is stepping up to continue the membership of Beeper, which [they acquired](https://automattic.com/2024/04/09/automattic-acquires-beeper/) earlier this year.
> 
> Automattic has invested a great deal into the open source ecosystem, including Matrix, and we’re grateful that now includes the Matrix.org Foundation. The Foundation stewards the protocol, facilitates open governance, operates the Matrix.org homeserver, and convenes the ecosystem at annual events like [the Matrix Conference](https://2024.matrix.org/). None of this is possible without the generous support of organizations like Automattic.
> 
> We’re still fighting to make the Foundation sustainable. Does your organization build on Matrix? The time to [become a funding member](https://matrix.org/membership/) is now.

### First report from the Matrix Governing Board

[HarHarLinks](https://matrix.to/#/@kim:sosnowkadub.de) announces

> It’s been 6 months since the first ever Matrix Governing Board was formally elected & announced, and it has had its first official meeting about one month ago. The Governing Board is an advisory board that is made up of elected representatives from all across the Matrix ecosystem - if you're unfamiliar, you can read more about what it is [here](https://matrix.org/foundation/governing-board-elections/). Since we represent all of you in the ecosystem, we strive to be as transparent as we can about what we have been doing, and today we are sharing our first report - just in time for the end of the year holidays. 😉
> 
> In it, you will find a both summary as well as the detailed minutes of the last meeting, and what the follow-up since then has been like, with an outlook of what our next steps are. Also included is the official report from the Spec Core Team. Very exciting to me personally is that we are working on setting up some initial Working Groups as well as a process for the community to propose more! But enough rambling from me, [head right over to the blog](https://matrix.org/blog/2024/12/governing-board-first-report/) to read it yourselves!
> 
> We look forward to sharing our next report soon. FOSDEM is coming up, many of us will be there and at the Matrix fringe event, and we look forward to meeting you if you can make it there! In the meantime, we have set up the brand new ✨️ [#governing-board-office:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#governing-board-office:matrix.org), ✨️ please join us for any questions about or to the Governing Board you may have!
> 
> See you soon!

## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Dendrite ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite))

Second generation Matrix homeserver

[neilalexander](https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:dendrite.matrix.org) says

> This week, Dendrite was [updated to 0.14.0](https://github.com/element-hq/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.14.0), the first release since the adopting the AGPL licence.
> 
> Notably this release includes fixes for a long-standing event auth bug which could cause unexpected state resolution issues and state resets in rooms and is a highly recommended upgrade for Dendrite users.
> 
> Support for fallback keys has also been added and the order in which one-time keys are claimed has been adjusted (as per MSC4225). Support for listening and connecting via Tor and I2P is also now available, as well as the `via` parameter for room join requests. Updates to gomatrixserverlib feature several performance improvements that will reduce memory allocations.
> 
> The move to the AGPL licence also aligns with a move to [a new GitHub repository](https://github.com/element-hq/dendrite) under the Element GitHub organisation. This also means that the Docker images are also [available at a new location](https://github.com/element-hq/dendrite/pkgs/container/dendrite-monolith) going forward. 
> 
> What hasn't changed though is the community room at [#dendrite:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org), which continues to be the place to go for Dendrite-related discussion.

## Dept of Clients 📱

### Element X iOS ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios))

A total rewrite of Element-iOS using the Matrix Rust SDK underneath and targeting devices running iOS 16+.

[Doug](https://matrix.to/#/@douge:matrix.org) reports

> Here we go, the final TWIM update for 2024 from the Element iOS team! We’ve rounded out our year by pushing the Release Candidate for v1.9.10 to TestFlight which enables the Media Browser for everyone to use. You can find it from the room details screen under “Media and files” so give it a go and let us know what you think. We’re all taking a break now so expect this release to land in the App Store on 6th Jan 2025 🎉
> ![](/blog/img/yEZgkdLwEfWyeCsCsxBpdfpO.avif)

### Element X Android ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-android))

Android Matrix messenger application using the Matrix Rust SDK and Jetpack Compose.

[benoit](https://matrix.to/#/@benoit.marty:matrix.org) reports

> Last TWIM for EXA! The work on the gallery is nearly done, the feature will be enabled in the next release that we schedule to release in production next Year. Knocking is also getting the latest refinement. The team is having a break, see you in 2025!

### Tammy ([website](https://tammy.connect2x.de))

Multiplatform messengers build on top of Trixnity Messenger

[Benedict](https://matrix.to/#/@benedict:imbitbu.de) announces

> The next version of Tammy (based on the new version of Trixnity Messenger) has been released with some awesome changes!
> 
> The first highlight is the Flatpak build for Linux. This means that Tammy now officially runs on all common desktop platforms.
> 
> The timeline used to have some problems as one of the oldest components. For the user, this was noticeable through flickering elements or OutOfMemoryExceptions when scrolling a lot. It was previously very difficult for developers to add custom events to the timeline. Thanks to a fundamental rebuild, these problems are now a thing of the past. Not only is the timeline now virtually flicker-free (we will be tackling the last things soon), it now also allows infinite scrolling by removing old elements from the memory. All this makes scrolling through the timeline extremely fast (see video). Developers now also have the ability to add custom events with minimal effort. Both at SDK and UI level!

### Christian's Neoboard Advent Calendar

[Christian Paul (jaller94)](https://matrix.to/#/@jaller94:matrix.org) announces

> It's almost Christmas which will mark the end of my advent calendar full of NeoBoard templates. I hope some will find joy in playing the games or use the backgrounds for presentations. It certainly made me happy, coming up with this many use cases for Matrix-powered whiteboards.
> 
> Here are some of the highlights:
> 
> * [Door 15: Team Sudoku](https://chrpaul.de/posts/2024-12-15-neoboard/)
> * [Door 16: Spring background](https://chrpaul.de/posts/2024-12-16-neoboard/)
> * [Door 17: Build your dream island](https://chrpaul.de/posts/2024-12-17-neoboard/)
> 
> All doors and templates are available in English and German.
> 
> Happy holidays, Matrix community!

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰

### matrix-rust-sdk

[poljar](https://matrix.to/#/@poljar:matrix.org) reports

> This week marked significant strides in stabilizing the SDK as we approach the end of the year. One of the key highlights is the introduction of initial support for a persistent event cache. This feature ensures that events are stored long-term, allowing users to return to a fully populated timeline even after closing and reopening their application.
> 
> Additionally, we released version 0.9 of the Matrix Rust SDK, packed with updates and fixes to improve performance and reliability.
> 
> Here are some of the notable improvements from this week:
> 
> * Replaced the optional `RequestConfig` argument in `Client::send()` with a new `with_request_config()` builder method for cleaner configuration handling.
> * Fixed an error that occurred when loading older serialized data from storage. This issue had caused apps to fail to start correctly due to problems with loading crypto information.
> * Introduced snapshot testing for certain serializable data, ensuring that format changes are detected during development.
> * We now differentiate between rooms a user has left and rooms they have been banned from.
> 
> We will see you next year for even more exciting improvements.

## Dept of Services 🚀

### Synapse Admin 

[Aine [don't DM]](https://matrix.to/#/@aine:etke.cc) announces

> A while back, we at [etke.cc announced our Synapse-Admin fork](https://etke.cc/news/xueua5a7nvgjzxldyu52gkw7viftcthp8cz-m3dyi_8/?utm_source=twim&utm_medium=matrix&utm_campaign=synapse-admin). This week, we’re excited to introduce more new features and bugfixes improvements!
> 
> **["Purge Remote Media" button](https://github.com/etkecc/synapse-admin/pull/237)**
> 
> Previously there was button to purge local media only, but now you can cleanup remote cache as well!
> 
> _(for [etke.cc](https://etke.cc) customers only)_ **[Server Notifications indicator and page](https://github.com/etkecc/synapse-admin/pull/240)**
> 
> You won't miss any important information with the new notification system - it extends the one we already have with email and Matrix notifications, adding yet-another option to see the details, now directly in Synapse Admin!
> 
> **Use the protocol (`http://`,`https://`) from homeserver URL  for `/.well-known/matrix/client` lookups**
> 
> Previously the `https://` was hardcoded, but apparently there are Matrix servers with internal-only access that use `http://` protocol, and for such cases the `https://` lookups caused delays in rendering and subpar user experience.
> 
> With this release the issue is no more!
> 
> **Correctly handle MXIDs with not just-domain homeservers**
> 
> Previously Synapse Admin was unaware about `domain:port` or even IPv6-only homeservers (`@user:example.com:1234` or `@user:2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`), oops! Now it treats such cases properly, without producing odd duplicated here and there
> 
> **The last release in 2024!**
> 
> The `v0.10.3-etke35` is the **35th** release of our Synapse Admin fork, and the last (_planned_) one in 2024!
> We wish you happy holidays and want to take some break. But don't you worry, _slaps the roof of Synapse Admin_ - that bad boy can **still** fit even more features in it! So, stay tuned, 2025 will bring even more interesting things

### Draupnir ([website](https://github.com/the-draupnir-project/Draupnir))

A moderation bot for open Matrix communities

[Gnuxie 💜🐝](https://matrix.to/#/@gnu_ponut:matrix.org) announces

> [Draupnir](https://github.com/the-draupnir-project/Draupnir), a moderation bot for open matrix communities, has released [v2.0.0-beta.9](https://github.com/the-draupnir-project/Draupnir/releases/tag/v2.0.0-beta.9). This release includes a rework of protection settings, starting with a tutorial that explains how to display and change any configurable settings that a protection might offer <https://the-draupnir-project.github.io/draupnir-documentation/protections/configuring-protections>. We'll make some minor improvements to this over the next couple of weeks but our focus is now on squashing the remaining [issues](https://github.com/the-draupnir-project/Draupnir/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22MPS+Follow+Up%22) blocking the 2.0.0 release. Which we expect to happen one way or another very soon, whether we squash them all by then or not. I have also written a tiny [update](https://marewolf.me/posts/draupnir/2407.html) for the devlog. That's all, see you in [#draupnir:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#draupnir:matrix.org).
