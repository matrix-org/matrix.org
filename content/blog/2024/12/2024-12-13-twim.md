## Dept of *Status of Matrix* 🌡️

[Matthew](https://matrix.to/#/@matthew:matrix.org) reports

> Last week US Senators Wyden (D) and Schmitt (R) wrote an [open letter](https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/wyden-schmitt_dod_letter.pdf) to the US Department of Defense encouraging them to adopt Matrix more widely, rather than wasting money on unencrypted, centralised or closed systems.  The letter also reveals a whole bunch of info at the end about the US Navy's Matrix deployments.  This feels like a huge step change forwards - not only is the [FBI encouraging citizens to use end-to-end-encryption](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/12/06/fbi-warns-iphone-and-android-users-stop-sending-texts/) in the wake of realisations that the public telephone network is insecure, but US Senate is pushing for Matrix adoption (without any lobbying from us, I hasten to add). You can read more about it at the [Element blog](https://element.io/blog/senators-implore-department-of-defense-to-expand-the-use-of-matrix/) (Element provides the deployments for the US Navy).
> 
> P.S. it really is bleakly amusing that we've been constantly pointing out that legislation like EU's ChatControl and the UK's Online Safety Act are catastrophically flawed because the surveillance backdoors they propose *will* be exploited and abused by attackers.  And here we are, with the lawful intercept backdoors in the US public phone system being compromised by attackers, causing the FBI to recommend non-backdoored E2EE instead.  We live in a very strange timeline.

## Dept of Spec 📜

[Andrew Morgan (anoa) {he/him}](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io) reports

> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <https://spec.matrix.org/proposals>.
> 
> 
> ### MSC Status
> 
> **New MSCs:**
> * [MSC4239: Room version 11 as the default room version](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4239)
> * [MSC4238: Pinned events read marker](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4238)
> 
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
> * *No MSCs are in FCP.*
> 
> **Accepted MSCs:**
> * [MSC4225: Specification of an order in which one-time-keys should be issued](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4225)
> * [MSC4147: Including device keys with Olm-encrypted events](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4147)
> 
> **Closed MSCs:**
> * *No MSCs were closed/rejected this week.*
> 
> ### Random MSC of the Week
> 
> The random MSC of the week is... [MSC3006: Bot Interactions](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3006)!
> 
> We haven't had one of these in a while, so I figured, why not!
> 
> This MSC talks about "bot interactions", which are additional ways that users can interact with bots other than text - namely client-rendered buttons. Ironically, the rise of LLMs in the years since this MSC was published have brought human-computer text interaction to the forefront, but buttons still have their place!
> 
> A bot can define their interactions as a state event and send it into the room. Then clients that see that state event can populate user menus with the actions that bots support! Clicking on a button will send a message into the room that a bot would parse as per usual (so really this is just a shortcut to typing commands out manually). The benefit is users don't need to remember commands (and don't need to !help all the time - cough cough mjolnir), and can quickly issue a potentially lengthy command without typing.
> 
> This seems like a cool feature to me. If any bot or client devs feel the same, consider reaching out on the MSC and offering your feedback!

## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Synapse ([website](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/))

Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by Element

[Till](https://matrix.to/#/@s7evink:matrix.org) reports

> This week we released Synapse [1.121.0](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/releases/tag/v1.121.0) (and [1.121.1](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/releases/tag/v1.121.1)).
> 
> 1.121.1 is just a patch release to fix an issue building release docker images in our CI. As such, there is only a docker image for 1.121.1, not 1.121.0. 1.121.1 is otherwise functionally identical to 1.121.0.
> 
> 1.121.0 introduces experimental support for a number of MSCs ([MSC4190: Device management for application services](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4190), [MSC4076: Let E2EE clients calculate app badge counts themselves (disable_badge_count)](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4076)), as well as stabilises support for locking accounts. It also has bug fixes and limited initial support for returning information about suspended users via the Admin API.
> 
> Grab it while it's hot! 🔥

## Dept of Clients 📱

### Extera

[OfficialDakari](https://matrix.to/#/@officialdakari:extera.xyz) reports

> Recently, Extera got saved messages feature. To save a message, open it's menu and click Save. This feature can be changed at any time and is unstable. Also, now, users of extera.xyz can get an email on our domain. DM @mail:extera.xyz and say `!m help`.

### SchildiChat ([website](https://schildi.chat))

SchildiChat is a fork of Element for Android and Desktop, that used to focus on UI changes such as message bubbles and a unified chat list, but now also provides some additional tweaks and community-driven features that may not be on the roadmap for the upstream clients.

[SpiritCroc](https://matrix.to/#/@spiritcroc:spiritcroc.de) says

> While releases of [SchildiChat Next](https://schildi.chat/android/next/) (our fork of Element X for Android) have always been available on [my own F-Droid repository](https://schildi.chat/android/next/install-from-sc-fdroid/), we finally made it into the [main F-Droid repository](https://f-droid.org/packages/chat.schildi.android/) too!
> These F-Droid releases are [reproducible builds](https://f-droid.org/en/docs/Inclusion_How-To/#reproducible-builds) checked against my repo, so you know if it lands on the F-Droid repository that it matches what I built before.
> Compared to reproducible builds from Element X, F-Droid even builds our forks of the [Matrix Rust SDK](https://github.com/SchildiChat/matrix-rust-sdk) and the [Rich Text Editor](https://github.com/SchildiChat/matrix-rich-text-editor) from source rather than using prebuilts to include as dependencies.
> 
> On the feature side, one of the main points that made me switch back to the old SchildiChat app was the ability to manage rooms in spaces. Accordingly, I added a long-press action to the room list that allows you to select a room's parent spaces to add to or remove from. At the time of writing this change is still only included in beta builds behind a feature flag, but will probably arrive in a release build in the next few days.

### Element X iOS ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios))

A total rewrite of Element-iOS using the Matrix Rust SDK underneath and targeting devices running iOS 16+.

[Mauro Romito](https://matrix.to/#/@mauro.romito:element.io) says

> * We are doing great progress with message knocking and media gallery
> * We are also experimenting with the event cache, which will make the app even faster
> * Some design improvements are being made in the room details screen and the join room screen

### Element X Android ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-android))

Android Matrix messenger application using the Matrix Rust SDK and Jetpack Compose.

[benoit](https://matrix.to/#/@benoit.marty:matrix.org) reports

> * Pretty similar to what's happening on Element X iOS:
> * We are doing progress with room knocking
> * We are making progress on the media gallery and are integrating an audio player to play voice message and message with audio attachment
> * We are also experimenting with the event cache, which will make the app even faster. There is still work to do SDK side to make it usable so it's behind a disabled feature flag for now.

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰

### Trixnity ([website](https://gitlab.com/trixnity/trixnity))

Multiplatform Kotlin SDK for developing Clients, Bots, Appservices and Servers

[Benedict](https://matrix.to/#/@benedict:imbitbu.de) says

> The latest release of Trixnity introduces support for decrypted temporary files across all platforms! 🎉 This feature is crucial for handling media like video playback and PDF rendering that require secure but temporary access to decrypted content. Trixnity ensures to providing seamless and secure handling of such files, while maintaining compatibility with the old API.
> 
> For more information about this update, or to check out Trixnity, visit the project repository: <https://gitlab.com/trixnity/trixnity>.

### Synapse Admin Updates

[Aine [don't DM]](https://matrix.to/#/@aine:etke.cc) says

> A while back, we at [etke.cc announced our Synapse-Admin fork](https://etke.cc/news/xueua5a7nvgjzxldyu52gkw7viftcthp8cz-m3dyi_8/?utm_source=twim&utm_medium=matrix&utm_campaign=synapse-admin). This week, we’re excited to introduce more new features and quality-of-life improvements!
> 
> **[Media Tab for Rooms](https://github.com/etkecc/synapse-admin/pull/196)**
> 
> Previously, media management was limited to individual users (i.e., media uploaded by a _specific_ user). Now, you can manage media at the room level!
> 
> ⚠️ While the new media tab offers options to view and remove media per room, it’s worth noting that the [Admin API endpoint](https://element-hq.github.io/synapse/latest/admin_api/media_admin_api.html#list-all-media-in-a-room) for room media is more limited compared to the [user media endpoint](https://element-hq.github.io/synapse/latest/admin_api/user_admin_api.html#list-media-uploaded-by-a-user). Despite this, we hope this feature will assist with Matrix server moderation.
> 
> **[Account Suspension (MSC3823)](https://github.com/etkecc/synapse-admin/pull/195)**
> 
> Account suspension is here! This feature enables you to place users in a "read-only account" state as an alternative to locking accounts.
> 
> 💡 Note: Not all [Admin API endpoints](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/issues/18016) fully support the suspension flag yet, but support is expected to improve in future updates.
> 
> **[E.164-Based Matrix IDs (MSC4009)](https://github.com/etkecc/synapse-admin/pull/214)**
> 
> Support for E.164-based Matrix IDs is finally here!
> 
> Matrix IDs in the format `+123456:example.com` (with a `+` sign) have been valid since [Matrix v1.8](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.8/appendices/#user-identifiers). However, Synapse Admin previously lacked support for these IDs - oops! This has now been addressed.
> 
> #### Spread the Word!
> 
> We at [etke.cc](https://etke.cc/?utm_source=twim&utm_medium=matrix&utm_campaign=synapse-admin) are incredibly proud of what we’ve accomplished with our Synapse Admin fork. Over the last three months, we’ve released an impressive **34 versions**, each packed with updates to make Synapse Admin _the_ go-to admin dashboard for Synapse.  
> 
> While we haven’t yet covered 100% of the API endpoints, and there’s still [work to be done](https://github.com/etkecc/synapse-admin/issues), the overall experience has improved dramatically.  
> 
> If you’ve appreciated the progress we’ve made, we’d love your help in spreading the word about [github.com/etkecc/synapse-admin](https://github.com/etkecc/synapse-admin)! Share it with homeserver owners and administrators you know, and let them discover the features we’ve worked so hard to deliver.  
> 
> Explore the [source code](https://github.com/etkecc/synapse-admin) or try the [admin.etke.cc (CDN version)](https://admin.etke.cc//?utm_source=twim&utm_medium=matrix&utm_campaign=synapse-admin).

## Dept of Bots 🤖

### I Don't Have Spotify Maubot

[HarHarLinks](https://matrix.to/#/@kim:sosnowkadub.de) says

> Do people sometimes share links to music with you on Matrix? They do for me. Often, people use Spotify as their music streaming service, but [I don't have Spotify](https://github.com/sjdonado/idonthavespotify).
> 
> Therefore about month ago, I shared a [maubot](https://mau.bot/) plugin on TWIM, which uses the REST API of sjdonado's [I don't have Spotify webapp](https://idonthavespotify.donado.co/), which itself is also selfhostable open source software.
> 
> As it turns out, people sometimes also share links to other streaming services not just with me but also with you!
> 
> So after a bit more tinkering, I have released [v1.1.0](https://github.com/HarHarLinks/maubot-idonthavespotify/releases/tag/v1.1.0) of my plugin <https://github.com/HarHarLinks/maubot-idonthavespotify>. It can now also be configured to check for any combination of spotify, apple, deezer, soundcloud, tidal, and youtube, which are all supported by idonthavespotify to different extent. Your mileage may vary depending on what you search, but that's up to the upstream project, since the plugin just connects whatever it does to matrix.
> 
> Let me know of any feedback you have at [#maubot-idonthavespotify:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#maubot-idonthavespotify:matrix.org)!

> [TARDIS](https://matrix-org.github.io/tardis/) has had a facelift! Matthew spent a weekend devising a custom layout algorithm and renderer which has now replaced `d3-dag`.
> 
> ![](/blog/img/ozPYslrUfnMjcKfOwHFpGjPt.png)
> 
> This is not only clearer for complex DAGs but also faster than the layout algorithm we previously used.
> We're currently using TARDIS to experiment with state resolution improvements.

## Dept of *Built on Matrix* 🏗️

### Acter ([website](https://acter.global/))

Your social organizing app build on matrix: A secure space to gather, engage and grow your community!

[ben](https://matrix.to/#/@ben:acter.global) says

> We have been working on deep-linking support in Acter for a while now. As per our usual process, progrress on that happens iteratively over the weekly releases. In the last few releases, we have added support for matrix.to and matrix:-URI-schemes on Mobile as well as started experimenting with our own acter:-scheme to support linking to specific items like Pins and Task-Lists. The current release already featuers support for that via a new QR-code you can scan from within the app to directly jump to specific items. As part of that effort, you can also link calendar-events and pins in boosts and you can easily do that from the newly designed share-screen from the object itself. It's glorious.
>
> On the other side, work on the Chat NG - the total rewrite of the chat UI infrastructure - is also progressing very well with support for bubbles and grouping of messages already in, and further message types being rendered properly now. It is still quite a bit from production ready but the improvement in architecture can already be felt very nicely in terms of UX speed and reactive-ness when you switch it on in your Labs.
>
> Last but not least, we have started with "spring cleaning"-sessions where larger parts of the team get together and walk through the app and discuss minor bugs and annoyances in a synchronised sessions and then try to fix them there and then - so we can speed up the process on these - or write them up as proper bugs if we can't fix them yet. A first sessions of this kind was done recently and fixed a bunch of minor annoyances. As usual the Github release page's Changelog has all the details.
>
> Additionally, we'd like to mention that we are looking for a [DevOps Person helping us run our Matrix Infrastructure](https://acter.global/jobs/) to extend the Acter Team. If that sounds interesting to you, [please apply](https://thehub.io/jobs/67582076a0a49c8efe3bc877) :) .
