The Matrix.org Foundation has been made aware that an international investigative operation [took down a service called MATRIX which was used by a cybercriminal network](https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/international-operation-takes-down-another-encrypted-messaging-service-used-criminals), which has no relationship with the Matrix.org Foundation or the Matrix protocol itself.

The [takedown site](https://www.operation-passionflower.com/) has a Matrix-the-movie branding, which is a probable source of confusion. The app showcased doesn’t look like any of the Matrix clients we’re aware of.

In a statement to the Matrix.org Foundation, Europol confirmed that the MATRIX cybercriminal network and the Matrix protocol are entirely unrelated. Europol states:

> The Matrix protocol (matrix.org) is by no means connected to the Matrix secured communication service that was targeted in OTF Continental.

A [statement from the Dutch police](https://www.politie.nl/nieuws/2024/december/3/11-opnieuw-versleutelde-communicatiedienst-criminelen-ontmanteld.html) confirms that this is unrelated: "Matrix is ​​also the name of a company and communications protocol of the same name, which has nothing to do with the crypto communications service Matrix."
