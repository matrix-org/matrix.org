Hey all,

Another 9 MSCs have been released today in [Matrix 1.13](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.13/)! It’s just over 2 months since [Matrix 1.12](https://matrix.org/blog/2024/10/07/matrix-v1.12-release/) went out, and the last scheduled release for 2024 - the next release is planned for around FOSDEM 2025. Today’s release contains more T&S features and a number of clarifications and improvements. The full changelog is at the end of this post, per usual :)

## Account suspension

Last release brought [Account *Locking*](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.13/client-server-api/#account-locking) to the spec, and this release brings [Account *Suspension*](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.13/client-server-api/#account-suspension) - a highly related but semantically different feature. Locking prevents the user from accessing their account, typically as a consequence of security reasons or restrictions, while suspension aims to disrupt while retaining a (mostly) readonly experience for the user. Both actions are reversible, and available to safety and security teams to help manage their servers with alternatives to deactivation (a destructive, irreversible, action).

Clients should continue calling `/sync` to detect when a lock/suspension is lifted (or converted to deactivation). [MSC3939](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3939) and [MSC3823](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3823) both have suggestions on what a UI could look like for the different states.

## Reporting rooms

[Event reporting](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.13/client-server-api/#post_matrixclientv3roomsroomidreporteventid) has been in the spec since the very early days of Matrix, allowing users to send concerns about particular content to their homeserver administrators for review. A notable gap in this functionality is being able to report whole rooms from the public room directory or out of band in general - this has been addressed in Matrix 1.13 with the new [report room endpoint](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.13/client-server-api/#post_matrixclientv3roomsroomidreport).

The T&S team continues to work on designing a possible replacement to reporting in general, considering functionality like appeals, report-to-moderators, classification, and other quality of life improvements.

## Up next in Matrix 1.14 and 2025

Mentioned earlier in this post, Matrix 1.14 is expected to be released around FOSDEM 2025 in early February. Many of the Matrix 2.0 features, like OIDC and Simplified Sliding Sync, are getting ever-closer to the needed proposed-FCP state to become part of the spec. We currently expect that the Matrix 2.0 features will land in either Matrix 1.14 or Matrix 1.15, converting the applicable release to Matrix 2.0 as a specification version. This is highly dependent on the MSCs progressing through FCP though, and may get pushed out as needed.

As always, if there’s an MSC ready for FCP, let us know in the [SCT Office room](https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org)! We’re currently on an administrative break until January 8th, 2025, but we’re still around and prioritizing features as we see them.
