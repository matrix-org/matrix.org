## Dept of *Status of Matrix* 🌡️

### Welcoming Ercom as a Silver Member

[Josh Simmons (m.org)](https://matrix.to/#/@joshsimmons:matrix.org) says

> We'd like to welcome [Ercom](https://ercom.com/) as the newest Silver Member of the Matrix.org Foundation and are excited to announce a couple other new members before the end of the year 🚀
>
> The Matrix.org Foundation stewards the Matrix protocol specification, facilitates open governance, and convenes the ecosystem. While Matrix continues growing in adoption, the Foundation's funding is not keeping pace. If your organization builds on Matrix and is invested in its future, the time to [become a funding member](https://matrix.org/membership/) is now.

### Matrix.org protocol is not MATRIX

[Josh Simmons (m.org)](https://matrix.to/#/@joshsimmons:matrix.org) announces

> From the department of [no-the-other-Matrix](https://matrix.org/blog/2024/12/unrelated-cybercriminal-network-taken-down/): This week saw news of Europol shutting down an encrypted messaging service called MATRIX. All indications are that this has nothing to do with the Matrix protocol, and we are grateful to the agencies and [publications](https://nos.nl/artikel/2546901-politie-las-mee-in-criminele-chat-app-miljoenen-berichten-onderschept) that have made an effort to disambiguate. We are, of course, monitoring the situation as more information becomes available.

## Dept of Spec 📜

[Andrew Morgan (anoa) {he/him}](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io) reports

> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <https://spec.matrix.org/proposals>.
>
>
> ### MSC Status
>
> **New MSCs:**
>
> * *There were no new MSCs this week.*
>
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
>
> * [MSC4147: Including device keys with Olm-encrypted events](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4147) (merge)
>
> **Accepted MSCs:**
>
> * [MSC3823: Account Suspension](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3823)
>
> **Closed MSCs:**
>
> * *No MSCs were closed/rejected this week.*
>
> ### Spec Updates
>
> Folowing on from last week, the SCT continues to work towards the next spec release, expected in mid-December with Account Suspension, backwards compatibility for captions, and likely some further work towards Matrix 2.0 in the form of crypto MSCs.
>
> Folks are encouraged to raise their MSCs for review in the [SCT Office](https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org) as soon as they feel it's ready for broad review. This helps ensure there are minimal process delays, and feedback can be incorporated into the feature design early. This is especially important for Matrix 2.0 MSCs, which the SCT hopes to be able to release in the new year.

## Dept of Widgets 🧩

### NeoBoard Widget ([website](https://neoboard.io/))

[Kim Brose (Nordeck)](https://matrix.to/#/@kim.brose:nordeck.io) announces

> [NeoBoard Widget v2.0.0](https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-neoboard/releases/tag/%40nordeck%2Fmatrix-neoboard-widget%402.0.0) is a major version update due to some significant tooling changes. Still, it has several new user-facing features.
> We picked these highlights for you:
>
> **Custom font sizes for text shapes**
>
> The font size in text shapes can now be set to a specific size. We offer a list of recommended values but you can always use the `auto` sizing, which adjusts the font size to the dimensions of the shape.
>
> **Inserting or importing a PDF**
>
> We extended the "Import" and "Insert here..." feature to also support PDF files, alongside the native `.nwb` format. Doing this will render each PDF page as an image in a new slide.
>
> {{figureVideo(vid="/blog/img/RGeNiAiflRseUrRxbHkHBmwf.mp4",caption="A demo of importing a matrix flyer to NeoBoard")}}
>
> **Monitoring the user's online state**
>
> We added a snackbar to the board that provides troubleshooting information when there are issues saving your data.
> For example, the widget monitors your network connection status to determine if you’re online, making it clear that content changes to the board or updates from collaborators cannot sync while you’re offline.
> It also looks out for rate-limiting scenarios and provide context-aware information when it is possible.
>
> **Updated tooling and build process**
>
> In this release, we migrated away from Facebook's [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) (CRA) framework in favour of the new and actively maintained [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) framework. We also swapped out our testing framework from [jest](https://jestjs.io/) to the Vite-native [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/).
> This is modernizing the build process and improving security, but requiring updates to build scripts, configurations, and imports due to the switch to ECMAScript modules (ESM).
>
> **Support for IPv4-only deployments**
>
> It is now possible to deploy the widget container on hosts without IPv6 support through a configuration option. This can be toggled easily through our [Helm charts](https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-neoboard/blob/0456eeddc25016410663df42d6c96142bd7afea8/charts/matrix-neoboard-widget/values.yaml#L82).
> Beyond that, the container image also gained the ability to also add your own files with custom config that will be added to the nginx server block config, should you need that.
> Read more about both in our [documentation](https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-widget-toolkit/blob/%40matrix-widget-toolkit/widget-server%401.1.0/containers/widget-server/README.md#custom-listen-directive).
>
> We also released updates to our [NeoChoice](https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-poll/releases/tag/v1.5.0) and [NeoDateFix](https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-meetings/releases/tag/%40nordeck%2Fmatrix-meetings-widget%401.7.0) widgets to match this feature.
>
> **...and more!**
>
> As usual, we try to improve existing features and fix bugs whenever we can. Check out the [changelog](https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-neoboard/releases/tag/%40nordeck%2Fmatrix-neoboard-widget%402.0.0) for a more detailed report of what has changed.

### vodozemac-python ([website](https://pypi.org/project/vodozemac/))

A python binding to the implementation of Olm and Megolm in pure Rust.

[OdoItal](https://matrix.to/#/@me:shahpaarth.com) reports

> Happy to announce that the pypi package [vodozemac](https://pypi.org/project/vodozemac/) has gotten its first release in 2 years to `0.8.1`, matching the latest (at the time of writing) published version of the official rust crate of the same name.
>
> The published packages include binary distributions across many different platforms and architectures (everything supported by `maturin`), as well as a `srcdist`.
>
> The previous version was published from the now-abandoned [matrix-nio/vodozemac-bindings](https://github.com/matrix-org/vodozemac-bindings). In the light of the deprecation of `libolm`, it became clear that modernized python bindings to the supported matrix encryption library is an absolute must, and it's possible now!
>
> The new repo itself is <https://github.com/matrix-nio/vodozemac-python>
> It's very much a WIP, with documentation and certain usability QoL items still left to implement, but it's expected to be usable as-is.
>
> Not finalized yet, but I'm roughly planning to institute a verisoning scheme that strictly follows that of the rust crate `vodozemac`, with a subversion to account for any changes that don't relate to the actual underlying library.
>
> PRs are extremely welcome, especially for helping getting to replace `pyolm` with `vodozemac` in `matrix-nio`!

### etke.cc ([website](https://etke.cc))

Your matrix server on your conditions

[Aine [don't DM]](https://matrix.to/#/@aine:etke.cc) announces

> #### Synapse Admin Updates  
>
> A while back, we at [etke.cc announced our Synapse-Admin fork](https://etke.cc/news/xueua5a7nvgjzxldyu52gkw7viftcthp8cz-m3dyi_8/?utm_source=twim&utm_medium=matrix&utm_campaign=synapse-admin). This week, we're excited to share a roundup of new features and quality-of-life (QoL) improvements we've introduced!  
>
> **[Prefill Any Login Form Fields with GET Parameters](https://github.com/etkecc/synapse-admin/pull/181)**  
>
> Previously, you could prefill the `username` and `server` fields in the login form using GET parameters for convenience. With this update, the `password` (for credentials-based auth) and `accessToken` (for access token-based auth) fields can also be prefilled.  
> ⚠️ Due to security considerations, this feature is restricted to local environments only.  
>
> **[Documentation Index Added](https://github.com/etkecc/synapse-admin/blob/main/docs/README.md)**  
>
> We're slowly documenting all the enhancements we've made to Synapse Admin. To make navigation easier, we've introduced a structured index page that organizes the documentation by sections.  
>
> *(exclusive to [etke.cc](https://etke.cc/) customers)* **[Server Status Page & App Bar Indicator](https://github.com/etkecc/synapse-admin/pull/182)**  
>
> A new status page and app bar indicator are now available! Using our [monitoring service](https://etke.cc/services/monitoring/), you can view your server's status via Matrix, email, or the web UI.  
>
> **Unified List View: Show 50 Items by Default**  
>
> Lists for all resources - users, rooms, media, reports, tokens, and more - now display 50 items by default. This change offers a more consistent experience across devices, especially on larger-than-phone screens. Previously, lists showed either just 10 items (leaving the page mostly empty) or an overwhelming 500 items.

> [Source code](https://github.com/etkecc/synapse-admin), [admin.etke.cc (CDN version)](https://admin.etke.cc//?utm_source=twim&utm_medium=matrix&utm_campaign=synapse-admin).

### @unomed/react-native-matrix-sdk

[Johannes](https://matrix.to/#/@h3nn3s:matrix.org) says

> We've recently released [react-native-matrix-sdk](https://github.com/unomed-dev/react-native-matrix-sdk) which wraps the *entire* FFI bindings of [matrix-rust-sdk](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk) in a React Native Turbo Module by way of [uniffi-bindgen-react-native](https://github.com/jhugman/uniffi-bindgen-react-native). We have successfully used this library to prototype a cross-platform app including room list and timeline but it is a fairly young project and will most definitely still have a few sharp edges.
>
> If anyone would like to try this out in their own projects, we'd be happy to receive feedback and contributions via [GitHub](https://github.com/unomed-dev/react-native-matrix-sdk). We also hang out in <https://matrix.to/#/#rn-matrix-rust-sdk:matrix.org> and <https://matrix.to/#/#uniffi-bindgen-js:matrix.org> if you want to chat.
>
> Thanks a ton to [Unomed](https://www.unomed.ch/) for sponsoring my work on this and to [James Hugman](https://github.com/jhugman) and his sponsors, [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/) and [Filament](https://filament.dm/), for creating and maintaining [uniffi-bindgen-react-native](https://github.com/jhugman/uniffi-bindgen-react-native).
