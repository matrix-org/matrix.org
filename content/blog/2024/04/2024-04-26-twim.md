> #### *a very cool, featureful fork of Conduit*
>
> **conduwuit** is a well-maintained, hard-fork of Conduit with tons of new features, many bug fixes, *huge* performance improvements, quality of life enhancements, moderation tools, and much more! I have been working on this since January and progress has been outstanding. It's time to share my joy with all of you too. The best part: conduwuit is a **full drop-in replacement for Conduit**. It's fully database compatible, with no migration necessary. You can even go back if you don't like it.
>
> Check out the [**full list of differences here.**](https://conduwuit.puppyirl.gay/differences.html)
> There is so much. I can only highlight some of the big stuff:
>
> * 👁️  **Read-receipts** federated in real-time.
> * ⌨️  **Typing** indicators over federation.
> * 🙋‍♀️  Complete **presence** support.
>
> All of these features are *fast*. Your client will feel snappy. Conduwuit has been the leading server in both [#ping:maunium.net](https://matrix.to/#/#ping:maunium.net) and [#ping-no-synapse:maunium.net](https://matrix.to/#/#ping-no-synapse:maunium.net) for many weeks in a row.
>
> I encourage you to give it a try and join [#conduwuit:puppygock.gay](https://matrix.to/#/#conduwuit:puppygock.gay) 💜. The public homeserver I host running conduwuit is available for use by entering `transfem.dev` as the server-name in your client of choice.
>

### Element X Android ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-android))

Android Matrix messenger application using the Matrix Rust SDK and Jetpack Compose

[benoit](https://matrix.to/#/@benoit.marty:matrix.org) reports

> * We have focused on 2 main topics this week:
>     * permalink navigation: this will land very soon, thanks to new APIs provided by the SDK, which allow you to navigate to any event of a timeline. Room and user navigation is already available on the nightly version. Once this is done, we will handle navigating to a replied event, and also external link navigation, to let Element X open matrix.to links.
>     * Login with QR code: while there were very positive tests on login using a QR code, the last tweaks and tests are being added and it'll need some time to be fully stable.
> * We have also improved the verification screen to help users if they need to create a new recovery key.
> * And the bug around re-verifying verified sessions has been fixed.

If you're familiar with things like "Open WebUI", "SillyTavern", etc, this is similar but more limited.
