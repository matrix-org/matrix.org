### conduwuit ([website](https://github.com/girlbossceo/conduwuit))

[strawberry (it/pup/she/they) 🏳️‍⚧️ 🦴💜🩷](https://matrix.to/#/@strawberry:puppygock.gay) reports

> [@this-week-in:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/@this-week-in:matrix.org)
> 
> #### _a very cool, featureful fork of Conduit_ 
> 
> **conduwuit** is a well-maintained, hard-fork of Conduit with tons of new features, many bug fixes, _huge_ performance improvements, quality of life enhancements, moderation tools, and much more! I have been working on this since January and progress has been outstanding. It's time to share my joy with all of you too. The best part: conduwuit is a **full drop-in replacement for Conduit**. It's fully database compatible, with no migration necessary. You can even go back if you don't like it.
> 
> Check out the [**full list of differences here.**](https://conduwuit.puppyirl.gay/differences.html)
> There is so much. I can only highlight some of the big stuff:
> * 👁️  **Read-receipts** federated in real-time.
> * ⌨️  **Typing** indicators over federation.
> * 🙋‍♀️  Complete **presence** support.
> 
> All of these features are _fast_. Your client will feel snappy. Conduwuit has been the leading server in both [#ping:maunium.net](https://matrix.to/#/#ping:maunium.net) and [#ping-no-synapse:maunium.net](https://matrix.to/#/#ping-no-synapse:maunium.net) for many weeks in a row.
> 
> I encourage you to give it a try and join [#conduwuit:puppygock.gay](https://matrix.to/#/#conduwuit:puppygock.gay) 💜. The public homeserver I host running conduwuit is available for use by entering `transfem.dev` as the server-name in your client of choice.
> 
> I'd like to personally thank various contributors for helping me get conduwuit going:
> [@jason:075-141-169-120.res.spectrum.com:8447](https://matrix.to/#/@jason:075-141-169-120.res.spectrum.com:8447) for everything, from performance and optimisation, to the core Matrix things and some features.
> [@@tom:doctoruwu.uk](https://matrix.to/#/@tom:doctoruwu.uk) for the Docker CI and other Docker related work.
> [@morguldir:sulian.eu](https://matrix.to/#/@morguldir:sulian.eu) for Docker and Nix-CI work.
> [@charles:computer.surgery](https://matrix.to/#/@charles:computer.surgery) for the initial GitHub Actions CI port and help with various Nix-related things.
> [@benjamin:computer.surgery](https://matrix.to/#/@benjamin:computer.surgery) for getting tokio-console working to optimise and test this release.
> [@qubic:qubicfluff.pl](https://matrix.to/#/@qubic:qubicfluff.pl) for Complement with Nix, misc Nix work for macOS, and working on a load tester written in Rust for conduwuit.
> [@jason:littlevortex.net](https://matrix.to/#/@jason:littlevortex.net) for finding critical bugs inherited from upstream, providing watcherbot: the essential toolbox for homeserver development, and Complement testing suite help.
> [@raizo:raizo.dev](https://matrix.to/#/@raizo:raizo.dev) for integrating loole to replace tokio channels which increased federation performance.
> 
> Special thanks to the various folks helping with development testing, code spot checks, and/or current donors not listed above: [@aranjedeath:explodie.org](https://matrix.to/#/@aranjedeath:explodie.org), [@efscher:matrix.nyc.what.if.ua](https://matrix.to/#/@efscher:matrix.nyc.what.if.ua), [@frebib:spritsail.io](https://matrix.to/#/@frebib:spritsail.io), [@k900:0upti.me](https://matrix.to/#/@k900:0upti.me), and everyone else who helps out.

## Dept of Clients 📱

### Element X Android ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-android))

Android Matrix messenger application using the Matrix Rust Sdk and Jetpack Compose 

[benoit](https://matrix.to/#/@benoit.marty:matrix.org) reports

> * We have focused on 2 main topics this week:
> 
>     - permalink navigation: this will land very soon, thanks to new APIs provided by the SDK, which allow you to navigate to any Event of a timeline. Room and user navigation is already available on the nightly version. Once this is done, we will handle navigating to a replied Event, and also external link navigation, to let Element X open matrix.to links.
>     - Login with QR code: while there were very positive tests on login using a QR code, the last tweaks and tests are being added and it'll need some time to be fully stable.
> * We have also improved the verification screen to help users if they need to create a new recovery key.
> * And the bug around re-verifying verified sessions has been fixed.

### Elm SDK ([website](https://github.com/noordstar/elm-matrix-sdk))

A more consistent alternative to the matrix-js-sdk, written in Elm.

[Bram](https://matrix.to/#/@bram:matrix.directory) reports

> 
> With the main functionality (rooms) being implemented, the Elm SDK is soon arriving at one of its first versions where a basic client can be built in beta. Soon, the first Elm client since [Scylla](scylla.danilafe.com) and the [chess client](chess.noordstar.me) will be able to emerge. 🌱

[Patrick](https://matrix.to/#/@patrick:jackson.dev) says

> It's an AI model frontend in Matrix, that connects to many different backends. There is a [blog post](https://jackson.dev/post/chaz/) introducing it as well.
> 
> Chaz is a Matrix bot that uses your [AIChat](https://github.com/sigoden/aichat) config to connect to ChatGPT, local ollama instance, Claude, or other LLM APIs and provide a chat experience from within Matrix. If you're familiar with things like "Open WebUI", "SillyTavern", etc, this is similar but more limited.
> 
> There is a demo instance, but right now this is something that you'll need to run yourself so that you can use your own API keys to access the backends.
