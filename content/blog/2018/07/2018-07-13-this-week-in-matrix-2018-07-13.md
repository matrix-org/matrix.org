Welcome to TWIM for Friday the 13th! Nothing too scary, but lots of client updates and news.

## Quaternion

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a>:

> <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/Quaternion">Quaternion</a> has gained a new <code>/html</code> command that allows one to send raw HTML. Note that an actually displayed HTML subset entirely depends on the receiving client; no HTML validation or sanitation is done; a plaintext version is automatically created by stripping all the HTML tags.

## neo

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@f0x:lain.haus">f0x</a> is working on <a href="https://github.com/f0x52/neo">Neo</a> again:

> added emotes, working localecho and <code>/rainbow</code>

## matrix-logger

A useful tool from <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@CromFr:matrix.org">CromFr</a> for anyone who wants to archive logs of rooms.

> I wrote a small matrix "client" for logging messages in joined rooms, and store them in a format very similar to Weechat logs.
> <a href="https://gitlab.com/CromFr/matrix-logger/tree/master">Source code (Rust)</a> <a href="https://gitlab.com/CromFr/matrix-logger/tags">Binary release (x86_64 windows & linux)</a>
> Please open issues if encounter any bug or need specific features.\\nAlso I'm new to rust, so any review / advice would be appreciated :)

## Matrique client progress

<a href="http://matrix.to/#/@bhat:encom.eu.org">Black Hat</a> has been working on <a href="https://gitlab.com/b0/matrique-go">Matrique</a>, and it's looking really good! Screenshot below.

> Matrique now has support for sending/receiving messages (plaintext, markdown, HTML, rainbow), emotes and notices. It also supports receiving images, videos, files and states. I am still working on file receiving functions.

I love that all clients include rainbow messages.

## fluffychat for Ubuntu Touch

New to me, <a href="https://github.com/ChristianPauly/fluffychat">fluffychat</a> is a "Simple Matrix Messenger for <a href="https://ubports.com">Ubuntu Touch</a>". The design philosophy for this app is focused on simplicity, and the hope is for it to complement <a href="https://github.com/uMatriks/uMatriks">uMatriks</a>, another Ubuntu Touch client.

> Why are you not just contributing to uMatriks?
> uMatriks is great and it's superb, that someone has created a Matrix Client for Ubuntu Touch. But sometimes you have a so detailed vision of a user interface, which you want to implement, that you can not just contribute to an existing project. However, I would like to work with the uMatriks developers together. We could use the same push gateway for example.
