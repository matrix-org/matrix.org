## matrix-synapse for Docker and k8s

<a href="https://github.com/ananace/">Ananace</a> has been working on configuration files for Synapse:

> So now the K8s stuff has configuration examples for Synapse + Riot + mxisd + coturn, all runnable on your very own Kubernetes cluster - though with some manual tinkering required at the moment.<br />I've updated the Kubernetes configuration examples to include everything you need for a full Matrix stack; Synapse + Riot + mxisd - using the built-in K8s ingress<br />And + coturn of course, not to forget

Take a look: <a href="https://github.com/ananace/matrix-synapse">https://github.com/ananace/matrix-synapse</a>

## mautrix-telegram is now the primary Telegram bridge on t2bot.io

<a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a>:

> <a href="https://t2bot.io">t2bot.io</a> is now running <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a> as the primary Telegram bridge. Feel free to join the other 10k users on the bridge and bridge your own Telegram group to your room: <a href="https://t2bot.io/telegram/">https://t2bot.io/telegram/</a>.

We should give a big shout of thanks to <a href="@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> for his consistent and continued work on mautrix-telegram.

## Debian packaging

> I'm packaging Circle IRC/Matrix client for Debian and backporting synapse to stable.

## Google Summer of Code

The second evaluation for <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/?sp-search=matrix">GSOC 2018</a> is nearly here, so we have some updates from the student participants:

## [apwhitehat](@apwhitehat:matrix.org) is working on [Dendrite](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite)

> Dendrite updates for TWIM (before GSoC 2nd eval):
> This month we've got most of the federation APIs working on Dendrite. These are:
> <ul>
>   <li>State APIs <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/486">#486</a></li>
>   <li>Get missing events API <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/516">#516</a></li>
>   <li>Query user devices <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/498">#498</a></li>
> </ul>
>
> We still need to figure out pagination for backfill API.
>
> On applications services, we've got a lot of APIs working, thanks to <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a>. Authentication now acknowledges App services, though lot of other stuff is under review. I am eagerly waiting for it to land.

On the same topic, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz">anoa</a> says:

> We've had a PR from fadeAce/dirichlet_zby for the server-side implementation of end-to-end encryption support in <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite">Dendrite</a>. Will be looking forward to seeing that land as well.

There is an explanation of the endpoints required for this <a href="/docs/spec/client_server/r0.3.0.html#end-to-end-encryption">in the CS API docs</a>.

## Zil0 is working on E2E in the Python SDK

Sounds like <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@Zil0:matrix.org">Zil0</a> has been going great guns on the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk">matrix-python-sdk</a>:

> Encryption in matrix-python-sdk should now work fairly well.<br />The biggest parts to write were device tracking and key persistence. All the PRs are now opened, and the code is fully tested and documented.<br />It is possible to try out the implementation before it lands by referring to instructions written here.<br />Also a special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/poljar">poljar</a> for some great work on new Olm bindings, which allowed the project not to get stuck with packaging issues.<br />Further work include encrypted attachments, device verification and key sharing.

## koma, kotlin client

Last week I mistakenly referred to <a href="https://github.com/koma-im/koma/">Koma</a> as being written in Rust, then Java. This was all incorrect, though being written in Kotlin, Koma does run on the JVM and use JavaFx.

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@sideboat:matrix.org">sideboat</a>:

> This week in <a href="https://github.com/koma-im/koma/">koma</a>, we are improving the room info window used for viewing and editing the name, icon, and aliases of a room. In the upcoming release, user power levels will be taken into account, so that editing options will only be shown when the user has enough power.

## Synapse

Neil says:

> We've just cut the next release candidate for Synapse: 0.32.0rc1.<br />The upcoming release focuses almost entirely on security; fixing federation bugs and adding new features for countering abuse.

## Riot

This week we welcome Bruno to the Riot team, he's off and away working on getting integration tests set up.

Otherwise:
<ul>
  <li>More work on the Jitsi integration</li>
  <li>More work troubleshooting E2E failures</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/releases/tag/v0.15.6">v0.15.6</a> and <a href="https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web/releases/tag/v0.15.7-rc.1">v0.15.7-rc.1</a> now available</li>
</ul>

## Self-reference

This week was only six days long, but to make up for it we'll have a bumper eight day edition next time! Come join us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#TWIM:matrix.org">#TWIM:matrix.org</a> and share what you've made.
