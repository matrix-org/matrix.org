Announcing his update nearly a week ago, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@radicus:matrix.org">radicus</a> released <a href="https://github.com/koma-im/koma/releases/tag/0.7.3">v0.7.3</a> of <a href="https://github.com/koma-im/koma/">koma</a>.

## dialogflow connector

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@vurpo:vurpo.fi">vurpo</a> has released <a href="https://gitlab.com/vurpo/matrix-dialogflow">matrix-dialogflow</a>, which allow the use of DialogFlow agents as chatbots:

> I've written a little bot for connecting a DialogFlow agent to Matrix as a chatbot. I did this for my own personal purposes but I know someone else might find this handy as well.

## mautrix-telegram

<a href="@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a>:

> New stuff in mautrix-telegram:
> <ul>
>  	<li>A basic telematrix database import script</li>
>  	<li>Improved config for relaybot message formatting, including the option to use Matrix displaynames (instead of just mxid localparts)
> I've also been planning an improved Matrix-&gt;Telegram formatting converter and a provisioning API for integration managers like Dimension.</li>
> </ul>

## jmsdk

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ma1uta:matrix.org">ma1uta</a> has been working on a matrix client this week. To that end, he has implemented <a href="https://github.com/ma1uta/jmsdk">jmsdk</a>, a "very early version of the matrix sdk and common classes (client, bot, …)"

> Currently implemented the matrix client on the java with full support of the C2S API. It still under development and contains bugs.

He has also been working on a "bot sdk with core classes to write custom bots and appservices."

## [matrix-appservice-voip](https://github.com/kamax-io/matrix-appservice-voip)

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@max:kamax.io">Max</a> has been working on VoIP bridging between Matrix and regular phones using Freeswitch:

> We have successful VoIP bridging between Matrix and regular phones using Freeswitch, for 1:1, both directions! a v0.1 is scheduled in a few days once configuration is possible and a getting started doc is written.
>
> Next steps:
> <ul>
>  	<li>more voice backends (think Jitsi, etc.)</li>
>  	<li>SMS support with Twilio and/or OVH initially</li>
>  	<li><a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/mxisd">mxisd</a> integration to automatically invite bridge users if needed and suggest bridge users</li>
>  	<li><a href="https://github.com/kamax-io/mxhsd">mxgwd</a> integration to auto-join HS regular users if a VoIP bridge user invites them, so &gt; calls are directly seen</li>
>  	<li>And much more in later releases</li>
> </ul>

## transform

A wild <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bettiah:matrix.org">bettiah</a> appeared, announced a completely new homeserver implementation in TypeScript:

> I have been working on a homeserver implementation over at <a href="https://github.com/bettiah/transform">https://github.com/bettiah/transform</a> . It is fairly basic at the moment, but the development experience is straight-forward and even fun.

I'm interested to see a TypeScript backend running, and of course it's great to have more homeserver implementations! Some highlights from the <a href="https://github.com/bettiah/transform">readme</a>:

> Transform is a matrix homeserver built using Typescript and Redis. It is not fully functional yet.
> <strong>Status:</strong> Register, Login, CreateRoom, Invite & Join seem to be functional with riot web client. But quite a lot of functionality is missing and the software is definitely not ready for deployment in a public facing role.
> <strong>Design:</strong> A lot of the code is auto-generated from the excellent swagger specs for the client-server api.
> <strong>Contributing</strong>: It is early days yet. However, Typescript has enabled safe & rapid progress. Redis streams too seem to have a very well thought out api and the whole thing has been a fun experience so far. Contributions are very welcome.
