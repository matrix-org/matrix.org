## Fractal Hackfest

Developers and creators of <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Fractal">Fractal</a>, the GNOME Matrix client, have been holding a <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Hackfests/FractalDecember2018">Hackfest this week in Seville</a>. Matthew and I caught up with them on video for Matrix Live this week, and discussed the product improvements they've been making and their plans for the next release (due next week!)

## Matrix Spec

<ul>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1466">MSC1466</a></strong> merged. <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/erikj/soft_logout/proposals/1466-soft-logout.md">MSC1466 from Erik describes</a> "Soft Remote Logout", which avoids loss of encryption keys in circumstances of remote logout.</li>
 	<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1730">MSC1730</a></strong> entered FCP (<em>final comment period</em>, the last step before being merged.) <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/rav/proposal/cs_api_in_login/proposals/1730-cs-api-in-login-response.md">read the proposal</a></li>

## This Week in Ruma

We don't often get to feature news from <a href="https://github.com/ruma/ruma">Ruma</a>, but this week there is an updated <a href="https://www.ruma.io/news/this-week-in-ruma-2018-12-09/">This Week in Ruma</a>.

> Ruma is not dead, however, and small improvements have continued over the last year. The Matrix spec has advanced quite a bit and many of the blocking issues for Ruma have been resolved. Rust's maturity is another story. async/await is still under development and this is the most significant blocking issue to progress on Ruma.

## maubot new tooling

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net">tulir</a> has been working on tooling for <a href="https://github.com/maubot/maubot">maubot</a>:

> maubot got a command-line tool for building plugins and managing maubot instances. I also added some server-side stuff for easy registration of accounts in the management interface using synapse shared secrets, but the UI for that isn't ready.
> Also, I'm planning on adding some kind of small Matrix client in the management interface for manually managing the added bot clients. That might lead to a separate library that could be used in other projects or embedded in websites.

## mxisd v1.2.1 released, updating recommended

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@max:kamax.io">Max</a> with a new release of <a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxisd">mxisd</a>:

> <a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxisd">mxisd</a> hits <a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxisd/releases/tag/v1.2.1">v1.2.1</a> with a new maintenance release, fixing bugs and regressions from v1.2.0. Updating to v1.2.1 is strongly encouraged as v1.3.x will contain breaking changes and will not be a straight-forward update like v1.x has been until now.

## Clients

### Lazy-loading lands in QMatrixClient

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org">kitsune</a> has reported that lazy-loading, a Matrix feature that entails only loading room member details as needed, is now in <a href="https://github.com/QMatrixClient/libqmatrixclient">libQMatrixClient</a> master.

> reference implementation in Quaternion will follow up

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bhat:encom.eu.org">Black Hat</a> has been testing the feature in <a href="https://gitlab.com/spectral-im/spectral">Spectral</a>, which uses the library, and says there is a 30%-50% reduction in RAM usage at startup.

### Riot Web progress on <code>/experimental</code> and v0.17.8 released

Bruno has been working on <a href="https://riot.im/experimental"><code>/experimental</code></a>, and I recommend taking a look at the progress there! The next version of Riot Web is closer than ever.

## Servers

### Synapse

A lot of focus on getting debian packages ready for python 3 - this is a blocker for our official python 3 release 0.34.0. Aside from that, finalising some outstanding state resolution behaviour (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1693">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1693</a>) and dusting off event ids as hashes (<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1127">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1127</a>.)

### Dendrite

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@brendan:abolivier.bzh">Brendan</a>:

> My internal audit of Dendrite is continuing, drawing a more and more precise picture of what's left to fix and implement. I aim to have it over by the end of the year, or the very early days of 2019 at the latest. Folks can track its progress through <a href="https://cloud.abolivier.bzh/index.php/s/qXi2KFjCQk2c6eG">https://cloud.abolivier.bzh/index.php/s/qXi2KFjCQk2c6eG</a>
