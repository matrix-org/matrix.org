In which Matthew & Amandine discuss The Matrix.org Foundation, go-live for the French Government deployment for Matrix, and some exciting random diversions into post-1.0 Matrix features which should land once once 1.0 is out the door!

## Purism sponsoring Fractal development

> <p dir="ltr" lang="en">We are proudly sponsoring the work of Julian Sparber on Fractal, the <a href="https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@matrixdotorg</a> client for GNOME. Read his latest update - <a href="https://t.co/q4ubjzETxC">https://t.co/q4ubjzETxC</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LibreDesktop?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LibreDesktop</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DemandFreedom?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DemandFreedom</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/gnome?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#gnome</a></p>

Purism announced they are sponsoring <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Fractal">Fractal</a> development, starting with <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@iamjsparber:matrix.org">Julian Sparber</a> working last month to improve the message view. You can <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/jsparber/2018/12/03/better-room-history-in-fractal/">read about his progress here</a>. Highlights:

> Before, there was a jarring cut when new messages were loaded, but now you can just scroll upward and older messages are loaded continuously.<br />The part I'm most excited about is the new "new message divider". When the user opens a room they can directly start reading the conversation from the last seen message and they don't need to search for the new message divider. Not only has the UX gotten a lot better, but also the underlying code is much cleaner now.<br />I also spent some time on making message rendering faster. I replaced the RegExp with more efficient code, this made the rendering much faster (from ~10ms to ~ 1ms) for every single message.<br />In summary, all of these things improve Fractal's UX a lot and make it feel more like a modern messaging app.

## Synapse 0.34.0rc1

<a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.34.0rc1">0.34.0rc1 is out</a> - please test it! 0.34.0 will be the first to officially support python 3. We're still working on the debian packaging but 0.34.0 proper should be out next week.

## Dendrite

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@brendan:abolivier.bzh">Brendan</a> has been getting on with Dendrite development:

> Started auditing Dendrite's codebase to identify what is left to implement, along with what hasn't been implemented correctly. Still a lot of work left to do on this, but it's looking promising so far.

## Modular

Modular is a Hosted Homeservers product, check out <a href="https://www.modular.im/">modular.im</a>. This week:

> Matrix -&gt; Matrix account migration tool available at <a href="https://www.modular.im/tools/matrix-migration">https://www.modular.im/tools/matrix-migration</a>. It's still beta, so please test it and let us know if you experience issues.

## New Homeserver: [linuxgaming.life](https://linuxgaming.life)

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@swedneck:swedneck.xyz">swedneck</a> has set up a new public homeserver at <a href="https://linuxgaming.life">linuxgaming.life</a>! There is also a Riot installation at <a href="https://riot.linuxgaming.life">https://riot.linuxgaming.life</a>, served via IPFS.

> Currently working on the website (based on <a href="https://t2bot.io/">t2bot.io</a>, thank you <a href="https://github.com/turt2live">travis</a> for making that <a href="https://github.com/t2bot/t2bot.io">available on github</a>!) and making things nicer in general.<br />I will be adding more bots shortly. Please let <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@swedneck:swedneck.xyz">me</a> know of any issues with the HS or anything surrounding it.

## Informo

<a href="https://github.com/Informo">Informo</a> is a project to create a specification and implementation for distributing information and news. This week they have been working on merging changes to the specification:

> Work on the Informo specifications has slowed down a bit in the last couple of weeks, though since the last update we did manage to get some relatively big SCSs merged into the specs, including <a href="https://github.com/Informo/specs/pull/9">SCS #9</a> (rendered <a href="https://specs.informo.network/information-distribution/article/">here</a>) which specifies how information sources must publish their information through the federation, and <a href="https://github.com/Informo/specs/pull/11">SCS #11</a> (rendered <a href="https://specs.informo.network/information-distribution/source/">here</a>) which describes how sources must register themselves in order to be picked up by clients, and handle localisation. ?<br />There's still a couple of big items to take care of before we can cut a 1.0 release of the Informo specs but this is definitely a huge step towards this goal.

## Minecraft Bridge

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@dandellion:dodsorf.as">Dandellion</a>:

> I started working on a Minecraft bridge pretty heavily based on Travis's old project, but using Minecraft-protocol instead of mineflayer.<br />You need a bot Minecraft account that can join and idle in the server, it then uses /tellraw to post messages.

## Redecentralize meetup in London

Last night Half-Shot & Neil & Brendan went to see the <a href="https://redecentralize.org/">Redecentralize</a> folk at their meetup:

> Beer! And pizza! And also Redecentralize<br />We chatted to a nice bunch of folks both demoing their decentralized projects and talked to the likes of scuttlebutt, BBC, IPFS and more. Was a interesting experience having around 8 minutes to quickly explain to newcomers what Matrix is and why they should use it in a speed dating format. We chatted (and demoed) bridges, <a href="https://riot.im/experimental/">new-riot</a> and generally how it all fits together. There were a lot of very interesting people with different profiles and backgrounds, and diversified questions which lead to a lot of interesting discussions.

<small>Note for the confused: the <em>format of the meetup</em> was comparable to speed dating. There is no suggestion that Matrix should be used at regular speed dating. If you do find <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-wishlist/issues/108">such a use for Matrix</a>, come tell us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#TWIM:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a>.

## The end of the post, and nearly the end of 2018

This week it has been winter-in-Europe kind of weather, but that's ok, it happens every year. TWIM on the other hand happens <em>every week</em>, so if you have something to share, and would like to share what you've been working on, come chat to us in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#TWIM:matrix.org">#twim:matrix.org</a>.
