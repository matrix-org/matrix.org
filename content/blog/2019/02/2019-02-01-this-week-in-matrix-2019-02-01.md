## Synapse

Neil and the team have been working frantically on getting a new Synapse release out this week:

> This week has been all about gearing up for v0.99.0 and if you would like to help us test it, our latest release candidate lives <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.99.0rc4">here</a><br />We've taken the decision to bump up to v0.99.0 because it is very much a precursor to v1.0. When v1.0 lands it will contain a breaking change that means all homeservers will need a valid certificate for their server to server endpoint, self signing will no longer be possible.<br />v0.99.0 contains support to help you do this, but once it lands all admins will need to upgrade, failure to do so will mean losing the ability to federate with &gt; v1.0 servers.<br />We'll have detailed docs ready to go alongside the full v0.99.0 release, and we plan to leave at least 1 month between v0.99.0 and v1.0, but for now please be aware that the change is coming.<br />Huge thanks to Rich, Erik, Hawkowl and Anoa for all their work in getting us to rc stage.

## nheko_reborn

If you haven't already heard, then I envy that you get to learn about it now: there is a credible new project which forks <a href="https://github.com/mujx/nheko">nheko</a> and seeks to maintain and continue the project.

<strong><a href="https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko">Nheko-Reborn</a></strong> is a new project headed by <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@red_sky:ocean.joedonofry.com">red_sky</a>, who told me:

> I think I'm getting pretty close to having another release ready. Need to clean up some things here and there and get the CI packages uploading correctly<br />It'd be good to have more community engagement

Come chat about the project in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#nheko-reborn:matrix.org">#nheko-reborn:matrix.org</a>.

## Riot iOS

<ul>
  <li>New app icons</li>
  <li>Most of e2ee keys backup screens are done. We are only missing the sign out warning which invited the user to back up their keys before logging out</li>
  <li>A Beta release is on its way to TestFlight</li>
</ul>

## Riot Android

<ul>
  <li>Finishing e2ee keys backup screen</li>
  <li>Integrate new app icons, and splash</li>
  <li>Release in Beta</li>

</ul>

## journal

<a href="https://github.com/lukebarnard1/">lukebarnard</a> has continued work on <a href="https://github.com/lukebarnard1/journal">journal</a>, a matrix-backed blog engine:

> I've posted another blog on <a href="https://github.com/lukebarnard1/journal">journal</a> about the next steps for the project, including my thoughts on verifying blog content.
>
> <a href="https://journal.lukebarnard.co.uk/journal/26-jan-2019">https://journal.lukebarnard.co.uk/journal/26-jan-2019</a>
>
> I'm planning to start work on the component that will scrape blog content from a matrix room. This will most likely involve a dedicated bot that syncs new journal blog events, verifies the blog signature and then writes the blog content to a file on the blog server.
>
> I'll probably ramble about the details of that at some point.

## matrix-docker-ansible-deploy

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com">Slavi</a> had two big updates for <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> this week, improved security and IRC bridging:

> <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> now has much-improved security. All services now run in containers with a non-root user from the very beginning, without capabilities and with a read-only filesystem. To learn more, see the <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/3f5b1ad1a5149a28713fa8b4fc0e53e04fefa349/CHANGELOG.md#2019-01-29">relevant changelog entry</a>.<br />Thanks to a contribution by <a href="https://github.com/Plailect">Devon Maloney (@Plailect)</a>, <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> now has IRC bridging support via <a href="https://github.com/TeDomum/matrix-appservice-irc">matrix-appservice-irc</a>.

## neo

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@f0x:lain.haus">f0x</a> again, now with an update on neo:

> Not too much work on Neo this week, but there's some smooth animations for the roomlist now <a href="https://f.0x52.eu/media/_cfcf1a510c2b4d198edacfbdd952cf0buntitled.mp4">video, with music</a>, which is surprisingly complicated in css<br /><a href="https://git.lain.haus/f0x/iris">https://git.lain.haus/f0x/iris</a>

## libaqueous - Matrix SDK in Dart

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@bhat:encom.eu.org">Black Hat</a> is working on a Matrix SDK in Dart:

> libaqueous (the Matrix SDK in Dart) is progressing nicely. A reference implementation is also planned.<br />The repo is at <a href="https://gitlab.com/b0/libaqueous">https://gitlab.com/b0/libaqueous</a>, and I also set up a room at <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#libaqueous:encom.eu.org">#libaqueous:encom.eu.org</a>

## ma1uta's Matrix projects: Jeon, JMSDK, matrix-jabber-java-bridge

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@ma1uta:matrix.org">ma1uta</a> has been working on his ecosystem of Matrix tooling:

> Not much changes in <a href="https://gitlab.com/ma1uta/jeon">jeon</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ma1uta/jmsdk">jmsdk</a> and matrix-jabber-java-bridge (mjjb).
> <ul>
>   <li>Jeon: improved mxid with a new validation, support of the 11 java. And preparing the new release.</li>
>   <li>Jmsdk: fixed few bugs.</li>
> </ul>

### [matrix-jabber-java-bridge](https://github.com/ma1uta/matrix-jabber-java-bridge/)

> The bridge is being re-written. I excluded the jabber server (still need to setup SRV records) and implementing the xmpp s2s api in the bridge.
> Done:
> <ul>
>   <li>rfc6120 in s2s part;</li>
>   <li>almost server dialback (XEP-0220);</li>
> </ul>
> Remaining:
> <ul>
>   <li>MUC (XEP-0045);</li>
>   <li>stabilize.</li>
> </ul>
> New version will allow:
> <ul>
>   <li>1:1 conversations between matrix and jabber users;</li>
>   <li>group chats by double-puppet mapping rooms to conferences;</li>
>   <li>additionally xmpp users can join directly to rooms via double-puppet bots.</li>
> </ul>
> Also I started breaking the bridge to modules. And the next module will be ActivityPub S2S module which allows communicate matrix servers with other fedivers.
