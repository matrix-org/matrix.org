Riot-web new version coming out so soon. So soon! It looks and runs great, you can use it today at <a href="https://riot.im/develop">https://riot.im/develop</a>. Includes a labs flag for displaying custom tags, which I love. Watch the vid.
<h2 id="fosdem2019">FOSDEM 2019</h2>
FOSDEM happened.
<ul>
 	<li>two Matrix-themed packed-room talks</li>
 	<li>lots of people coming to chat at the stall to say things like "hi" or "I like Matrix" or "what is Matrix? â€¦ wow that sounds amazing, how can I get involved?"</li>
 	<li>1000s of stickers decentralised out of my bag onto people's laptops</li>
</ul>
If you didn't yet, take a look at the <a href="/blog/2019/02/04/matrix-at-fosdem-2019/">summary blogpost, which also contains videos of both talks</a>.
<h2 id="synapse0990">Synapse 0.99.0</h2>
With the release of <a href="/docs/spec/server_server/r0.1.0.html">Server to Server Spec r0.1</a>, Synapse 0.99.0 is shipping now.
<blockquote>Synapse 1.0.0 will be compliant with r0.1 and the goal of Synapse 0.99.0 is to act as a stepping stone to Synapse 1.0. Synapse 0.99.0 supports the r0.1 release of the server to server specification, but is compatible with both the legacy Matrix federation behaviour (pre-r0.1) as well as post-r0.1 behaviour, in order to allow for a smooth upgrade across the federation.<br />It is critical that all admins upgrade to 0.99.0 and configure a valid TLS certificate. Admins will have 1 month to do so, after which 1.0.0 will be released and those servers without a valid certificate will no longer be able to federate with &gt;= 1.0.0 servers.</blockquote><br /><em>Please</em> <a href="/blog/2019/02/05/synapse-0-99-0/">read the announcement post</a> and be sure to come and chat in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#synapse:matrix.org">#synapse:matrix.org</a> if you need help!<br /><h2 id="gsoc2019">GSOC 2019</h2><br /><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cadair:cadair.com">Cadair</a> has been helping admin this year's GSOC application:<br /><blockquote>Matrix.org has applied to be a GSOC (Google Summer of Code) mentoring organisation. If your matrix project has a feature a summer student could tackle and you have the time to mentor them over the summer, why not <a href="http://matrix-org.github.io/gsoc/#/projects">add a project idea to our website</a> by submitting a PR to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/gsoc/tree/master/_projects">this repo</a>.

This is hopefully the last RC before release, but we would like as much testing as possible! the v1.3 branch is a big enhancement on the previous release with big performance and privacy improvements. It's smaller, faster, stronger and protects you privacy even better than before! You know you want it!</blockquote>
<h2 id="matrixdockeransibledeploynowsupportssynapsev099">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy now supports Synapse v0.99</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com">Slavi</a> reports that:
<blockquote><a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> now supports Synapse v0.99 and should be ready for Synapse v1.0.<br />If you're using the playbook to manage your Matrix server you should upgrade soon.<br />Depending on how you've customized your setup, you may not even have to do anything for the big Synapse v0.99/v1.0 transition, besides upgrading and re-running the playbook. A good place to start is the changelog entry: <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/46accfdb3c53f0a6b9e5fd7aacf9adaf21172ebc/CHANGELOG.md#synapse-v099-support-and-preparation-for-synapse-v10">Synapse v0.99 support and preparation for Synapse v1.0</a></blockquote>
I have been using these playbooks to test my own homeserver deployment and am happy.
<h2 id="tchapandroidclient">Tchap Android client</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@willem:canarymod.net">Willem</a> reports that:
<blockquote>After seeing a demo at FOSDEM of <a href="https://github.com/dinsic-pim/tchap-android">Tchap</a>, the app the French government uses to access their Matrix network, I decided to try to get it to work as a general-purpose Matrix client. The app uses email and password to log in, and infers the homeserver address from the homeserver name. So to get it to work, I had to patch the app and write a little proxy so it gets the proper homeserver (and optionally identity server) from an email address.<br />A patched version of Tchap can be found at <a href="https://github.com/14mRh4X0r/tchap-android">https://github.com/14mRh4X0r/tchap-android</a>, code for the proxy at <a href="https://git.snt.utwente.nl/14mRh4X0r/tchap-proxy">https://git.snt.utwente.nl/14mRh4X0r/tchap-proxy</a>. At the moment it's very crude, and images/files don't work since the virus scan API is unimplemented, but at least it can be used outside the French government. ?</blockquote>

<h2 id="preparingforsynapseonopenbsd">Preparing for Synapse on OpenBSD</h2>
<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@lindalap:matrix.org">Linda</a> has been making progress on a project to get Synapse running on OpenBSD, and to that end has been preparing and improving the dependencies that we take for granted on Linux. To summarise the current status:
<blockquote>This week I've been porting Synapse's dependencies to OpenBSD <code>-current</code> distribution. There is no port yet for Synapse in OpenBSD.
Ports missing from OpenBSD <code>6.4</code> for Synapse's dependencies were:</blockquote>
<ul>
 	<li><code>py-frozendict</code>: ok'd, waitingâ€¦</li>
 	<li><code>py-unpaddedbase64</code>: TBD</li>
 	<li><code>py-canonicaljson</code>: TBD</li>
 	<li><code>py-signedjson</code>: TBD</li>
 	<li><code>py-treq</code>: WIP (this will take a while, lots of dependencies)</li>
 	<li><code>py-daemonize</code>: ok'd, waitingâ€¦</li>
 	<li><code>py-pymacaroons</code>: TBD</li>
 	<li><code>py-phonenumbers</code>: <code>8.10.4</code> done, waiting to be importedâ€¦</li>
 	<li><code>py-prometheus_client</code> done, needs to be tested/importedâ€¦</li>
 	<li><code>coturn</code>: TBD, maybe?</li>
</ul>
waiting = usually waiting for an OpenBSD developer to "ok" and import
<blockquote>Of those, <code>py-phonenumbers</code> was added to OpenBSD<br /><code>-snapshots</code> (<code>-current</code>) distribution. <code>py-phonenumbers</code> (?) and <code>py-service_identity</code> received updates to ports. <code>py-prometheus_client</code>, <code>py-daemonize</code> and <code>py-frozendict</code> are ported ready and waiting to be given "ok" at OpenBSD's <code>ports@</code> mailing list.<br />There is <a href="https://github.com/jasperla/openbsd-wip/tree/master/net/synapse">an unofficial up-to-date Synapse port exists at GitHub</a> maintained by someone else, which I've not yet tested. (At glance, I can take a guess the <code>devel/tz</code> port may not be required.)<br />(<code>coturn</code> doesn't have a port yet, may have to look at it later.)</blockquote>
