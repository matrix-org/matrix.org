Huge week! Let's go!

## Matrix Live: Riot Redesign Chat (2019-02-08 - Season 3, Episode 13)

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fq3Q50RxQyM" frameBorder="0" allowFullScreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

Riot-web new version coming out so soon. So soon! It looks and runs great, you can use it today at <a href="https://riot.im/develop">https://riot.im/develop</a>. Includes a labs flag for displaying custom tags, which I love. Watch the vid.

## FOSDEM 2019

FOSDEM happened.
<ul>
 	<li>two Matrix-themed packed-room talks</li>
 	<li>lots of people coming to chat at the stall to say things like "hi" or "I like Matrix" or "what is Matrix? … wow that sounds amazing, how can I get involved?"</li>
 	<li>1000s of stickers decentralised out of my bag onto people's laptops</li>
</ul>
If you didn't yet, take a look at the <a href="/blog/2019/02/04/matrix-at-fosdem-2019/">summary blogpost, which also contains videos of both talks</a>.

## Synapse 0.99.0

With the release of <a href="/docs/spec/server_server/r0.1.0.html">Server to Server Spec r0.1</a>, Synapse 0.99.0 is shipping now.

> Synapse 1.0.0 will be compliant with r0.1 and the goal of Synapse 0.99.0 is to act as a stepping stone to Synapse 1.0. Synapse 0.99.0 supports the r0.1 release of the server to server specification, but is compatible with both the legacy Matrix federation behaviour (pre-r0.1) as well as post-r0.1 behaviour, in order to allow for a smooth upgrade across the federation.<br />It is critical that all admins upgrade to 0.99.0 and configure a valid TLS certificate. Admins will have 1 month to do so, after which 1.0.0 will be released and those servers without a valid certificate will no longer be able to federate with &gt;= 1.0.0 servers.

<em>Please</em> <a href="/blog/2019/02/05/synapse-0-99-0/">read the announcement post</a> and be sure to come and chat in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#synapse:matrix.org">#synapse:matrix.org</a> if you need help!

## GSOC 2019

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@cadair:cadair.com">Cadair</a> has been helping admin this year's GSOC application:

> Matrix.org has applied to be a GSOC (Google Summer of Code) mentoring organisation. If your matrix project has a feature a summer student could tackle and you have the time to mentor them over the summer, why not <a href="http://matrix-org.github.io/gsoc/#/projects">add a project idea to our website</a> by submitting a PR to <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/gsoc/tree/master/_projects">this repo</a>. Feel free to ask questions in <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#gsoc:matrix.org">#gsoc:matrix.org</a> as well.

## matrix-puppet-hangouts 0.1.0 released, with bidirectional image support

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@root:thomasprofitt.com">tom</a> reports that:

> <a href="https://github.com/matrix-hacks/matrix-puppet-hangouts/">matrix-puppet-hangouts</a> version <a href="https://github.com/matrix-hacks/matrix-puppet-hangouts/releases/tag/0.1.0">0.1.0</a> has been released!<br />This release adds bidirectional (Hangouts -&gt; Matrix and Matrix -&gt; Hangouts) image support!<br />It also bumps the version of <a href="https://github.com/matrix-hacks/matrix-puppet-bridge/">matrix-puppet-bridge</a> (the common core of matrix-puppet-bridge bridges, which handles most of the stuff that's the same between different third-party service bridges, and makes implementing new matrix-puppet-bridge bridges easier) required to 1.16.2, the current latest, for recent bugfixes that improve all <a href="https://github.com/matrix-hacks/matrix-puppet-bridge/">matrix-puppet-bridge</a> bridges.<br />0.1.0 also requires Python 3.5+, for async. Older versions of python3 won't work. PRs getting python3 &lt; 3.5 working again are welcome.

Praise indeed!

## matrix-media-repo from TravisR now supports .well-known server delegation

<a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> reports that:

> <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo">matrix-media-repo</a> now supports .well-known server delegation (compatible with Synapse 0.99 and r0.1 of the server-server specification), among many other bug fixes and improvements. Actually validating the certificates presented by servers will be implemented alongside Synapse 1.0's requirement for it.

## Dimension from TravisR now supports .well-known server delegation

Similar to <a href="https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo">matrix-media-repo</a> above, <a href="https://github.com/turt2live">TravisR</a> has been implementing .well-known server delegation in <a href="https://dimension.t2bot.io/">Dimension</a>:

> <a href="https://dimension.t2bot.io/">Dimension</a> now supports .well-known server delegation (compatible with Synapse 0.99 and r0.1 of the server-server specification). Actually validating the certificates presented by servers will be implemented alongside Synapse 1.0's requirement for it.

## mxisd v1.3.0-rc.3

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@max:kamax.io">Max</a>:

> <a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxisd">mxisd</a> <a href="https://github.com/kamax-matrix/mxisd/releases/tag/v1.3.0-rc.3">v1.3.0-rc.3</a> is out. This is hopefully the last RC before release, but we would like as much testing as possible! the v1.3 branch is a big enhancement on the previous release with big performance and privacy improvements. It's smaller, faster, stronger and protects you privacy even better than before! You know you want it!

## matrix-docker-ansible-deploy now supports Synapse v0.99

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com">Slavi</a> reports that:

> <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy">matrix-docker-ansible-deploy</a> now supports Synapse v0.99 and should be ready for Synapse v1.0.<br />If you're using the playbook to manage your Matrix server you should upgrade soon.<br />Depending on how you've customized your setup, you may not even have to do anything for the big Synapse v0.99/v1.0 transition, besides upgrading and re-running the playbook. A good place to start is the changelog entry: <a href="https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/46accfdb3c53f0a6b9e5fd7aacf9adaf21172ebc/CHANGELOG.md#synapse-v099-support-and-preparation-for-synapse-v10">Synapse v0.99 support and preparation for Synapse v1.0</a>

I have been using these playbooks to test my own homeserver deployment and am happy.

## Tchap Android client

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@willem:canarymod.net">Willem</a> reports that:

> After seeing a demo at FOSDEM of <a href="https://github.com/dinsic-pim/tchap-android">Tchap</a>, the app the French government uses to access their Matrix network, I decided to try to get it to work as a general-purpose Matrix client. The app uses email and password to log in, and infers the homeserver address from the homeserver name. So to get it to work, I had to patch the app and write a little proxy so it gets the proper homeserver (and optionally identity server) from an email address.<br />A patched version of Tchap can be found at <a href="https://github.com/14mRh4X0r/tchap-android">https://github.com/14mRh4X0r/tchap-android</a>, code for the proxy at <a href="https://git.snt.utwente.nl/14mRh4X0r/tchap-proxy">https://git.snt.utwente.nl/14mRh4X0r/tchap-proxy</a>. At the moment it's very crude, and images/files don't work since the virus scan API is unimplemented, but at least it can be used outside the French government. ?

## Preparing for Synapse on OpenBSD

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@lindalap:matrix.org">Linda</a> has been making progress on a project to get Synapse running on OpenBSD, and to that end has been preparing and improving the dependencies that we take for granted on Linux. To summarise the current status:

> This week I've been porting Synapse's dependencies to OpenBSD <code>-current</code> distribution. There is no port yet for Synapse in OpenBSD.
> Ports missing from OpenBSD <code>6.4</code> for Synapse's dependencies were:

<ul>
 	<li><code>py-frozendict</code>: ok'd, waiting…</li>
 	<li><code>py-unpaddedbase64</code>: TBD</li>
 	<li><code>py-canonicaljson</code>: TBD</li>
 	<li><code>py-signedjson</code>: TBD</li>
 	<li><code>py-treq</code>: WIP (this will take a while, lots of dependencies)</li>
 	<li><code>py-daemonize</code>: ok'd, waiting…</li>
 	<li><code>py-pymacaroons</code>: TBD</li>
 	<li><code>py-phonenumbers</code>: <code>8.10.4</code> done, waiting to be imported…</li>
 	<li><code>py-prometheus_client</code> done, needs to be tested/imported…</li>
 	<li><code>coturn</code>: TBD, maybe?</li>
</ul>
waiting = usually waiting for an OpenBSD developer to "ok" and import

> Of those, <code>py-phonenumbers</code> was added to OpenBSD<br /><code>-snapshots</code> (<code>-current</code>) distribution. <code>py-phonenumbers</code> (?) and <code>py-service_identity</code> received updates to ports. <code>py-prometheus_client</code>, <code>py-daemonize</code> and <code>py-frozendict</code> are ported ready and waiting to be given "ok" at OpenBSD's <code>ports@</code> mailing list.<br />There is <a href="https://github.com/jasperla/openbsd-wip/tree/master/net/synapse">an unofficial up-to-date Synapse port exists at GitHub</a> maintained by someone else, which I've not yet tested. (At glance, I can take a guess the <code>devel/tz</code> port may not be required.)<br />(<code>coturn</code> doesn't have a port yet, may have to look at it later.)
