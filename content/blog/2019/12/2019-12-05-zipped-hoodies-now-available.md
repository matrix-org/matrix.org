Matrix merch is some of the most sought-after apparel and adhesive labeling available in the world today. We supply discerning customers with t-shirts, hoodies and stickers which remind them which decentralised, federated, end-to-end encrypted communications protocol is the best choice.

This is all very well, but we wondered whether it would be possible to have a warm, hooded garment which promotes the wearers preference of chat system, and also has a zip on the front.

Today, weâ€™re proud to announce a breakthrough in this area: Matrix Zipped Hoodies are available now from **[shop.matrix.org](https://shop.matrix.org)**!
