## Dendrite

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@brendan:abolivier.bzh">Brendan</a> had this to say:-

> The Dendrite audit is over! A bunch of issues have been created on the Dendrite GitHub repository, as well as a project board in order to keep track of everything: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/projects/2">https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/projects/2
> </a>There's a fair amount of issues that have been labeled as “good first issue”, so feel free to pick them up and open pull requests if you're looking into hacking on Dendrite! :)

And whilst we have your attention - here's Brendan & Matthew talking through the audit in this week's Matrix Live!

### Synapse

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@neilj:matrix.org">Neil</a> says:-

> <b>both contain critical security updates </b><b>so please update asap</b> for more details, we'll be able to share a bit more about the vuln once admins have had a chance to upgrade.
>
> Meanwhile Hawkowl has been cranking out bug fixes and perf improvements and in particular taking a look at taming the user_ips table.

While Debian packager Andrewsh adds:-

## Bridges

<a href="https://matrix.to/#/@@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk">Halfshot</a> has this to say:

> Matrix-appservice-purple is being renamed to matrix-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bifr%C3%B6st" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bifröst</a>, on the basis that we now bridge to things and "burning rainbow bridge" seemed like a good description.
>
> Other things that have happened: <em>Performance improvements, as always. </em>XMPP -&gt; Matrix typing notifications <em>XMPP -&gt; Matrix avatars </em>XMPP -&gt; Matrix uploads * Matrix -&gt; XMPP uploads (via oob)

and then follows up with this:-

> As promised, we've got a discord bridge release out today. v0.4.0-rc1 has landed!

## Matrix.org Foundation

Matthew has a final draft of the Matrix.org Foundation governance document ready: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc1779/proposals/1779-open-governance.md">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc1779/proposals/1779-open-governance.md</a>. Comments on <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1779">https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1779</a> would be much appreciated!  We expect to propose merging it next week, and then incorporating it into the final Articles of the foundation.

## Riot Web

Loads and loads of work happening on <a href="https://riot.im/experimental">https://riot.im/experimental</a> which is now where all new development is happening as we race towards launching the new design.  Highlights include:
<ul>
  <li>All new key verification is implemented! (in olm & matrix-js-sdk).  We're currently hooking up the UX.</li>
  <li>Online key backup is pretty much finished.</li>
  <li>Cross-signing is up next.</li>
  <li>Redesign backlog is progressing (slightly stuck on making the RoomList resizing work nicely, but almost there)</li>
  <li>Finalising the all new registration/login screens</li>
  <li>...and loads of other stuff too.</li>
</ul>

Features include syncing of <a class="linkified" href="http://pnut.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pnut.io</a> names and avatars, matrix users ability to authorize their <a class="linkified" href="http://pnut.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pnut.io</a> accounts, and administrative controls for managing linked rooms.

A ca-certificates issue with Java 11 on Debian stable was found while running a bot on a headless server, more details and the solution is in the <a href="https://github.com/koma-im/kotlin-matrix-userbots" target="_blank" rel="noopener">README</a>

> Our first specs proposal of 2019 just landed in the form of <a href="https://github.com/Informo/specs/pull/16" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SCS #16</a>, which specifies the data/event structure for trust authorities. This is a big step as TAs play a key role in Informo's trust/reputation system!
>
> In the meantime, we've also opened <a href="https://github.com/Informo/specs/pull/19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SCS #19</a>, which proposes a rework of the specs' introduction with the idea to give newcomers a more accessible and immediate way to figure out what Informo is about, and give them some starting points so they can dive deeper into it if interested. It's a rather small one and we'd love people to give it a look so we can aim for the most newcomer-friendly version possible
>
> We've also just opened <a href="https://github.com/Informo/specs/pull/21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SCS #21</a> which specifies a way for a source to change the Matrix user it uses to publish articles (e.g. if it was previously using a server managed by non trustworthy people). As with all of our proposals introducing changes in behaviour, it's open for people to share their comments on it for the next 7 days.

Early testing and reporting about success/failure would be very much appreciated as v1.3.0 will break backward compatibility. We have been running it on our own servers for about a week now and feels really good and stable.

> It is a home server that does not rely on any passwords but on cryptography and user-owned storage.

> OI Chat uses one-time logins to verify the ownership of a username that can only be created by the user if they control the blockstack account.

...and that's all this week, folks!  Your normal hand-crafted artisanal benpa confectionery will be back next week.
