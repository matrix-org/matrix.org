## Matrix Live 🎙

{{ youtube_player(video_id="6M_FEMxsmwU") }}

## Dept of *Status of Matrix* 🌡

Last week Matrix had a presence at UbuCon Europe and PyCon Ireland. We gave workshops on using Matrix to create bots, and also a session on installing Synapse (see also: Brendan's entry below!)

> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PyConIE?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PyConIE</a>! We hope you enjoyed the Matrix workshop, find the slides and code samples at <a href="https://t.co/aT1dDuEcm1">https://t.co/aT1dDuEcm1</a> and make sure to ask any more questions! <a href="https://t.co/C2qwV5R3gl">pic.twitter.com/C2qwV5R3gl</a></p>&mdash; Matrix (@matrixdotorg) <a href="https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/1183060946580840451?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 12, 2019</a>

Tomorrow I'm off to sunny Manchester with Michael from the Ops team. We'll visit OggCamp, where we'll show off Matrix with a fun demo I previewed on Matrix Live a few weeks ago.

Matrix will ALSO be at:

* [Re­decentra­lize Conference 2019](https://redecentralize.org/events/2019-conference/)
* [MozFest 2019](https://www.mozillafestival.org/)

## Dept of Spec 📜

[anoa](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz):

> Last week we set [MSC1219](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/1219) (key backups), [MSC2241](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2241) (verification over DMs), and [MSC2313](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2313) (ban lists) for the spec core team to focus on. Those 3 are rolling on into this week as we didn't get a lot of work done last week :)

In other Spec news, Matthew uncovered a stone tablet describing what would in future be known as "[MSC2324](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2324)":

## Dept of Servers 🏢

### install-party, nice result from UbuCon Europe

[Brendan](https://matrix.to/#/@brendan:abolivier.bzh) said:

> For a workshop anoa and I did at Ubucon Europe last Sunday on how to install Synapse, I worked on a side project that creates a server, attaches a domain name to it and installs Riot and Caddy on it. Attendees can then SSH into it, follow the instructions to install a Matrix homeserver, and use Riot to register an account on it, log in, and join a federated room with all of the other attendees' homeservers in it.
> We tried it out last week-end for the actual workshop and it worked quite well 🙂
> The project is called Install Party, and lives at <https://github.com/babolivier/install-party>, and if you want to chat about it I've just created [#install-party:abolivier.bzh](https://matrix.to/#/#install-party:abolivier.bzh) 😉

### Synapse

[Neil](https://matrix.to/#/@neilj:matrix.org) reported:

> This week we've been thinking about the future and brainstorming on ideas to improve perf for small instances and sparing some cycles for [MSC1228](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1228). Next week we'll return to improving IO usage on matrix.org.

[Synapse 1.4.1](https://matrix.org/blog/2019/10/18/synapse-1-4-1-released) was released, which fixes a small regression in 1.4.0.

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰

### matrix-3ds-sdk

[sorunome](https://matrix.to/#/@sorunome:sorunome.de) said:

> Heya, [matrix-3ds-sdk](https://github.com/Sorunome/matrix-3ds-sdk/) is a new matrix sdk - for the Nintendo 3DS! It is still deep in development, so expect bugs, some things not working properly etc.
> Current features include:
>
> * logging in
> * sending text messages to rooms
> * redacting events from rooms
> * resolving aliases to room ids
> * basic framework to get a /sync loop working
>
> If you are into 3DS homebrew development or are interested in helping out making a full client based on this, please contact soru (@sorunome:sorunome.de)! 3ds homebrew dev is pretty new to her, so there are plenty of open questions / debugging help would be great!

This is really impressive, I'm looking forward to playing with it. (I'm sure someone at the office must own a 3DS!)

### koma

> [koma](https://github.com/koma-im/koma-library), Kotlin library for building clients: Added API for retrieving notifications.

### docker image of synapse-develop  

[Mathijs](https://matrix.to/#/@mathijs:matrix.vgorcum.com) announced:

> I've made a docker image of the develop branch of synapse, and automated it to build daily. It's on my [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mvgorcum/docker-matrix/tags) as mvgorcum/docker-matrix:develop, based on the avhost dockerfile.
> Note that there are no checks, the image is simply built from the develop branch of the synapse git repo every night.

## Dept of Tulir 🇫🇮

A special section this week from the guy with one editor open for everything, [tulir](https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net):

> I haven't done anything on my own projects this week, but I did contribute to a bunch of other projects:
>
> * Updated SmsMatrix to the latest matrix-android-sdk to fix outgoing sms duplication bug (<https://github.com/tijder/SmsMatrix/pull/60>)
> * Fixed Riot web sending reply fallbacks in edited message content (<https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/3551>)
> * Fixed some things in the Riot web edit html -> markdown parsing (<https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/3552>)
> * Made Riot web reply rendering much nicer and more compact (<https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/3553>)
> * Added full emoji picker for reactions to Riot web (<https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/3554>)
>
> The first two are already merged (and SmsMatrix even got a new release on f-droid), the html parsing is waiting for code review and the emoji picker and reply rendering are waiting for design review.
>
> Also, I made a read-only status.matrix.org rss feed room since some people wanted one: [#matrix.org-status:maunium.net](https://matrix.to/#/#matrix.org-status:maunium.net). I don't remember if I TWIMed these before, but [#xkcd:maunium.net](https://matrix.to/#/#xkcd:maunium.net) and [#commitstrip:maunium.net](https://matrix.to/#/#commitstrip:maunium.net) are similar read-only rooms, new xkcds and commitstrips are posted there whenever they come out.
