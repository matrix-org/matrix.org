## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Synapse 1.5.0 released

Various updates including a security fix, [check the announcement](https://matrix.org/blog/2019/10/29/synapse-1-5-0-released).

Several packaging projects have been updated to deploy the new version:

* [matrix-docker-ansible-deploy](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/) from [Slavi](https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com)
* [Kubernetes](https://github.com/ananace/matrix-synapse) from [Ananace](https://matrix.to/#/@ace:kittenface.studio)
* [multi-arch synapse docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/black0/synapse) from [Black Hat](https://matrix.to/#/@bhat:encom.eu.org)
* [avhost/docker-matrix](https://hub.docker.com/r/avhost/docker-matrix) and [mvgorcum/docker-matrix](https://hub.docker.com/r/mvgorcum/docker-matrix) from [Mathijs](https://matrix.to/#/@mathijs:matrix.vgorcum.com)

> Like always the mvgorcum/docker-matrix repo also includes the release candidates, as they were released.

### Install Party

[Brendan](https://matrix.to/#/@brendan:abolivier.bzh) announced:

> A couple of weeks ago I shouted here about a project I've been working on named [Install Party](https://github.com/babolivier/install-party), which provides tools for provisioning and managing servers for Matrix homeserver install workshops/parties.
>
> Since then, I've been working on improving it, and today it's finally reached v1.0! This version includes configurable DNS and infrastructure providers, the ability to create multiple server in one run, user-defined post-install scripts, as well as codebase cleanups and a better documentation.
>
> You can find more details about the project and this release at <https://brendan.abolivier.bzh/install-party-1.0/>, and in [#install-party:abolivier.bzh](https://matrix.to/#/#install-party:abolivier.bzh) 🙂

## Dept of Bridges 🌉

### mautrix-telegram

[Tulir](https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net) told us:

> * Parallelized file transfer: The bridge now has an option to use multiple telegram connections and a streaming connection to the Matrix media repo when copying files. This should make it much faster and use less ram for big files.
> * Matrix doesn't have native captions, so `!tg caption <text>` now exists to send the next image or file to telegram with `<text>` as the caption.
> * Animated sticker bridging and helm charts were merged into master.

### matrix-appservice-node 0.4.1 released

[Half-Shot](https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk) reported:

> Bridges-in-nodejs-fans, today we have released 0.4.1 of the [matrix-appservice-node](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-node) library. For those not aware (presumably most), this library is a barebones piece of kit that helps you to listen over the AS api for transactions, in a more barebones manner than `matrix-appservice-bridge`. The changes in this release are a total transformation of the library into Typescript, and updating dependency packages which had gotten out of date.
>
> **EDIT**: I cocked up the release, so have a 0.4.1

### matrix-appservice-bridge 1.11.1 released

[Half-Shot](https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk) offered:

> Also, <https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/releases/tag/1.11.1>

### #matrix-client-developers:matrix.org

[f0x](https://matrix.to/#/@f0x:pixie.town) announced:

> [#matrix-client-developers:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-client-developers:matrix.org) has been revived, intended for discussion between developers of different Matrix clients.

This is the room to head to for Matrix Client developer chat.

### Matrix Notepad

[KB1RD](https://matrix.to/#/@kb1rd:kb1rd.net) announced:

> Version 0.1.2 update brings a major overhaul of the user interface. The main features are:
>
> * A new sign in dialog (with password authentication. No access tokens!)
>     * Those who are already signed in will stay signed in
>     * Also created a Matrix Notepad logo
> * Technically, a single Matrix client is used instead of re-creating it each time a new document is opened
>     * This makes document loading faster
> * Added a document list and an add button
> * Added the document room ID to the URL
> * Fixed various bugs that have been encountered. Maybe I can _finally_ say that it's bug-free!

### Riot v1.5.1-rc.1

Riot v1.5.1-rc.1 is up on <https://riot.im/staging> with a collection of bugfixes, some further a11y fixes and... a new reaction picker from tulir!

## Dept of Bots 🤖

### matrix-episode-bot

[anoa](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz) told us:

> I made a bot that can give you links to TV show episodes that get mentioned in rooms: <https://github.com/anoadragon453/matrix-episode-bot>
>
> It's not as cool as it sounds. Basically you put all the titles and links in a config file and whenever someone says e.g "I really like S05E09", it'll give you the name of that episode and a link to it. You can also just mention an episode title and it'll give you the link.
>
> Made with [nio-template](https://github.com/anoadragon453/nio-template).
