## Matrix 1.0

The big news this week is that we declared ourselves to be out of beta. You'll want the [full post](https://matrix.org/blog/2019/06/11/introducing-matrix-1-0-and-the-matrix-org-foundation) for all details, but here's a taste:

>We are very excited to announce the first fully stable release of the Matrix protocol and specification across all APIs - as well as the Synapse 1.0 reference implementation which implements the full Matrix 1.0 API surface.
>
>This means that after just over 5 years since the initial work on Matrix began, we are proud to have finally exited beta!! This is the conclusion of the work which we announced at [FOSDEM 2019](https://matrix.org/blog/2019/02/04/matrix-at-fosdem-2019) when we cut the first stable release of the Server-Server API and began the Synapse 0.99 release series in anticipation of releasing a 1.0.

As part of the 1.0 we also announced the Matrix.org Foundation.

>For the full update on the Foundation, please check out the new website content at [https://matrix.org/foundation](https://matrix.org/foundation) which should tell you everything you could possibly want to know about the Foundation, the Guardians, the Foundation’s legal Articles of Association, and the day-to-day Rules which define the Open Governance process.

Thanks to everyone who has stuck with us along the way to make this possible.

## Synapse

We released Synapse 1.0.0 this week to coincide with Matrix 1.0. As a release Synapse 1.0.0 focuses on security and stability which in turn builds a firm foundation for the performance improvements that you can expect to see over the Summer. Read all about it [here](https://matrix.org/blog/2019/06/11/synapse-1-0-0-released).

## Crypto

We have not one but two working end to end demos of device cross signing! This is going to be huge and is key step towards being able to make Matrix e2ee by default.

Cross Signing Demo

Additional Treats

But wait there's more! Pantalaimon not only provides a way for clients and bots to participate in e2ee rooms, it now provides the ability to search. Checkout this (religious themed) [demo](http://s1.webmshare.com/1ZOvM.webm).

## Pattle

Pattle is going great guns at the moment. Here's [Wilko]:-

>A new version of Pattle has been pushed to F-droid!
>
> * Add ability to create group chats!
> * Show chat creation events ('Wilko has created this group')!
> * Show emote messages correctly!
> * Handle display name changes! Display names of messages will now be as they were at time of sending.
> * Don't show invite and join events in direct chats This is only happens for the two initial users in the direct chat. If someone invites someone else to the direct chat (trough another client), the invitation will show up in the timeline.
> * Use the timeout parameter while syncing. This means that receiving new messages should be way quicker! (Thanks Mathieu!)
> * Store messages retrieved remotely (thanks Mathieu!) This means that scrolling up in a chat will be faster now, because the messages are cached.
> * Always show a date header above the oldest event
> * Show replies correctly in chat overview
> * Show sent state icon next to own message in chat overview
> * Show newly joined rooms at the top in the chat overview
> * Use a bit bolder font for chat names in overview
>To install this release, add the following repo in F-droid:

>[Alexandre Franke] has [fixed](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/commit/98d8a82e7da7691bcd7782175680f05311c56d4f) [the regression he found last week](https://matrix.org/blog/2019/06/07/this-week-in-matrix-2019-06-07#fractal). The team also did a bit of housekeeping with a few dependency updates.

## Misc

[Half-Shot] reports that:

> I wrote a bot to control ansible playbooks <https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-ansible-bot>. I'm informed such a thing already exists as an ansible module, but I failed to realise that and wrote a independent one in TypeScript.

[tulir] reports that:

>I made a simple reminder maubot: <https://github.com/maubot/reminder> It's available at <https://matrix.to/#/@reminder:maunium.net>
>
>For room admins wondering if they can upgrade their rooms to v5, I made a bash script that checks all the servers in a room and prints a nice summary of the number of servers and members on each version: <https://gist.github.com/tulir/aa2df287a0d192b86e5b675687791d16>

[Atreatis] reports that:

> Currently [grin](https://matrix.to/#/@grin:grin.hu) is building a backend for matrixservers.net that will collect data and push statistics every hour to our website. Next to that I wanted to push forward that me and several others are looking into building a Code of Conduct that should help every new and existing home server. This code of conduct will be build and curated from scratch in-order to help and support the network or any general project.

[Pneumaticat] has this to say:-
>My homeserver (potatofrom.space) is open for some public registration! Also on [Atreatis]'s matrixservers.net.

They promise 'One nine of uptime guaranteed, or your money back' which sounds pretty like a bargain.

So that's it folks, until next week. Come and say hi at [#twim:matrix.org]
