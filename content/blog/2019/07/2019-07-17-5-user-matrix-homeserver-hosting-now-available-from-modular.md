Hi all,

If you’ve been looking for a way to have you own Matrix homeserver without having to run it yourself, you may be interested to hear that [Modular](https://modular.im) (the Matrix hosting provider run by [New Vector](https://vector.im), the startup which hires many of the Matrix core team) is now offering a personal-sized small homeserver hosting service, supporting a minimum size of 5 user servers.

A lot of recent performance work on Synapse has been driven by the need to make smaller dedicated servers more efficient to run - and so if you run your own homeserver you’ll be benefiting from all this work too :)  Meanwhile, if you choose to outsource your server hosting to Modular, you’ll be indirectly supporting core Matrix and Synapse development, given most of the core Matrix team work for New Vector - it’s through buying services like this which lets us keep folks able to hack on Matrix as their day job.

See more details [over at the Modular blog post](https://modular.im/personal-hosted-homeservers)!
