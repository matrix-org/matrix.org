### Notes on the Spec from tulir

> I made a few spec proposals: [MSC2244: Mass redactions](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2244) and [MSC2246: Asynchronous media uploads](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2246). Mass redactions are useful for fighting spam (and bridging telegram deletions) more efficiently. Asynchronous media uploads would make it possible for bridges (like telegram) to handle messages synchronously and thus keep message ordering without blocking all messages behind some media upload.

## Dept of Servers üè¢

### Synapse

Erik reported:

> * Busy landing the remaining items for the privacy project.
> * Reviewing and landing the room stats work Oliver has been busy with before he finishes his internship this week (thanks Oliver!).
> * Jorik has been doing the finishing touches to the Synapse installer (which looks awesome fyi).
> * We‚Äôve also been looking at a basic message retention implementation in Synapse.
> * Finally, Hawkowl had a lot of fun at Kiwi Pycon last week (woo keynote!), and is now back and looking at improving performance of outbound requests.

### Construct

Jason from Construct:

> Construct added support for server notice rooms. As the server administrator I've placed quick access to the server control room for myself in this section.
>
> Construct has also added support for the server-side commands `\\read <room-tag>`, for example `\\read m.low_priority` will mark all low-priority tagged rooms as read. The command `\\read *` also will mark all rooms as read.
>
> Also, we now allow users to configure whether they transmit typing events by setting state events in their home-room. If a user creates an event with the `type` of `ircd.typing.disable.send` and the `state_key` of the room_id, typing events will not be sent to that room for them. Further variations exist, such as `ircd.typing.disable.sync` to prevent the client from receiving typing events for a particular room or all rooms.

### Jojii email bridge NEW

[Jojii](https://matrix.to/#/@jojii:matrix.jojii.de) announced:

> For all those who want a new emailbridge, I have great news for you! The new bridge supports sending and writing emails, using multiple rooms for multiple email-addresses. In addition you can use markup to improve the style of your emailbody, which gets translated to HTML.  Here you can find the repository: [Matrix-EmailBridge](https://github.com/JojiiOfficial/Matrix-EmailBridge)

Go join [#jojiiMail:matrix.jojii.de](https://matrix.to/#/#jojiiMail:matrix.jojii.de) for more.

### Big news for the Slack bridges

[Half-Shot](https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk) offered:

> The Slack bridge has had a whole week of care applied to it. We've [switched the bridge entirely over to Typescript](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/pull/152), and overhauled large parts of the codebase to make future work easier (for ex, [using the Slack node library rather than request calls](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/pull/185)). If that's not exciting enough, we've also [added support for the RTM API](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/pull/164), which means the bridge can use websockets when talking to slack. This gives us nice things like typing updates, and the ability to deploy without needing a webserver to listen for events. Release 1.0 is imminent, but before then we are hoping to land [Postgresql support](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/pull/186) so that the bridge can scale up to meet the high demands placed upon it.

### mautrix-whatsapp

### igor: a Matrix bot framework for Elixir

[uhoreg](https://matrix.to/#/@uhoreg:matrix.org) offered:

> for fans of strange programming languages or of monster movie clich√©s, I've created a Matrix bot framework for Elixir: <https://gitlab.com/uhoreg/igor>

## Dept of Encryption üîê

[poljar]:

> Initial code dump of Seshat, a Matrix event indexer/database that should enable search for encrypted rooms in riot-desktop. The dump contains a rust library as well as node bindings. The [repo can be found here](https://github.com/matrix-org/seshat/tree/master/seshat-node).

## Dept of Ops üõ†

### ARM docker images for synapse

[Black Hat](https://matrix.to/#/@bhat:encom.eu.org) told us:

> Apparently there are no ARM docker images for synapse, so I built a [multi-arch synapse docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/black0/synapse). Supported CPU architectures include armv7, aarch64 and amd64.

## Dept of Bots ü§ñ

[tulir]:

> There's a useless [new maubot plugin](https://github.com/maubot/exec) that lets you run python and soon shell scripts from Matrix. Not intended as a public bot as it doesn't have any sandboxing, but it does have a "userbot" mode to run it under your own account so that you can use it in any room.

Slightly mean to call your own bot useless :(

## Final thoughts üí≠

If you've suffered from invite spam lately, you can solve the problem by following [these instructions](https://gist.github.com/turt2live/7bf1e589664298d786dfa6aeccda294a):

> There's 3 methods to block the room:
>
> 1. Use the synapse admin API for it:
> ```bash
> curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"new_room_user_id":"@abuse:YOUR_SERVER.org"}' 'https://YOUR_SERVER/_matrix/client/unstable/admin/shutdown_room/!BAD_ROOM:example.org'
> ```
> 2. Block the room with an antispam module ( https://github.com/t2bot/synapse-simple-antispam )
> 3. Ignore the user with `/ignore`

## That's all I know üèÅ
