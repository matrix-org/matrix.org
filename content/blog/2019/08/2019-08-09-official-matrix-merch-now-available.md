Here at Matrix we’re frequently asked for official merch. While those who choose to [sponsor Matrix development on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/matrixdotorg) have always been blessed with branded t-shirts, it was otherwise very difficult to obtain official merch.

Today, those dark times have ended, as we announce the **[Official Matrix Merch Store][shop.matrix.org]**!

Now available from **[shop.matrix.org]**, we’re offering packs of Stickers, T-Shirts, and Hoodies!

Stickers are provided in three types: hexagonal Matrix and Riot stickers, and rectangular transparent Matrix stickers.

T-Shirts are available in all sizes and in Unisex and Women's editions. We’re using Gildan SoftStyle t-shirts, which are popular amongst printed shirts for being both soft and durable.

Matrix-branded hoodies are something very special. Superbly embroidered, they are comfortable and stylish. On a recent trip to San Francisco, a passerby stopped a Matrix guardian in the street and asked where they could buy a Matrix hoodie *without knowing what Matrix was*.

You really need one of these.
