## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Synapse

Neil:

> This week we’ve been working on getting our brand new room directory implementation ready, creating a new Synapse installer, and creating a TURN server testing tool. We’ve also been pushing on with the privacy project and fixing up some bugs and perf issues.  
> Next week it’s all about getting the room directory out of the door, shipping the installer and continuing on with the privacy project. We are in the early stages of a project designed to reduce the load caused by outbound SSL connections, it is looking very promising. We’re also going to give the sqlite->postgres porting script some love as well as working on some message retention ideas, and also ways to reduce the meta data we store.

[Half-Shot](https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk) offered:

### 'matrixcli', new client enables Matrix as a unix util

Very interesting project: [matrixcli](https://github.com/saadnpq/matrixcli) is a versatile command line client using the [matrix-python-sdk](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk). It's not a conventional IM client, rather it exposes access to Matrix rooms so you can pipe to them as you would other Unix utils.

### Continuum progress

> [Continuum](https://github.com/koma-im/continuum-desktop)
>

## Dept of Encryption 🔐

### libQuotient E2E Progress (GSOC 🎓)

[aa13q](https://matrix.to/#/@aa13q:matrix.org) reported:

> Here's the small demo of the receiving messages process: <https://youtu.be/gGykLh4mVDg>

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰

### Matrix-ClientServer-API-java

They created [Matrix-Grep-Bot](https://github.com/JojiiOfficial/Matrix-Grep-Bot) using the API.

### flexible ansible role just for synapse

[JCG](https://matrix.to/#/@jan.christian:gruenhage.xyz) offered:

> For people looking for a rather flexible ansible role *just* for synapse, <https://gitlab.com/famedly/ansible/synapse> got your back. You can use it to deploy synapse with pip or docker, depending on what you prefer for your host. It's an actively maintained fork of <https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ansible-synapse>, which has been archived recently and was unmaintained for a while before that. It's just been updated to v1.3.1 too.
