### Foundational Research Paper on Garbage-Collection in Matrix using Cryptographic Proofs

[Florian Jacob](https://matrix.to/#/@bh7953:kit.edu) announces

> Wouldn't it be nice if your homeserver could garbage-collect all this ancient room history and just keep a small cryptographic proof that everything was alright?
> On that topic, we have published our [“Proof-Carrying CRDTs allow Succinct Non-Interactive Byzantine Update Validation”](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3721473.3722142). 
> Byzantine-fault tolerant CRDTs ("Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types") are the scientific basis for Matrix,
> and in this work, CRDTs are combined first-time with non-interactive cryptographic proofs, as they are known from the zero-knowledge field.
> At the example of Matrix, we evaluate whether that combination is futile.
> There is still a lot of research to be done to make this a reality in Matrix, but the results were better than we expected:
> While making every event carry a proof of authorization is not practical yet, one could add a proof to more seldom things like room upgrades.
> The [article](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3721473.3722142) is freely available as Open Acces under CC-BY, and [our implementation](https://github.com/kit-dsn/proof-carrying-crdts) is licensed MIT.
> This work was enabled by the [Decentralized Systems](https://www.dsn.kastel.kit.edu/) research group at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://kit.edu), and presented at this year's [Workshop on Principles and Practice of Consistency for Distributed Data](https://papoc-workshop.github.io/2025/).

### Synapse ([website](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/))

Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by Element

[Devon Dmytro](https://matrix.to/#/@devonh:one.ems.host) announces

> This week we released Synapse v1.130.0.
> 
> This release adds the following new features:
> * Add an Admin API endpoint `GET /_synapse/admin/v1/scheduled_tasks` to fetch scheduled tasks. [#18214](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/issues/18214)
> * Fix a longstanding bug where Synapse would immediately retry a failing push endpoint when a new event is received, ignoring any backoff timers. [#18363](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/issues/18363)
> * Pass leave from remote invite rejection down Sliding Sync. [#18375](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/issues/18375)
> 
> ... and a whole lot more!
> 
> Thank you to all our contributors for helping to make Synapse the best it can be.
> As always, feel free to stop by [#synapse:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#synapse:matrix.org) to join in on the discussion and if you encounter a bug make sure to report it [here](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/issues/new/choose).

## Dept of Clients 📱

### Extera

[OfficialDakari](https://matrix.to/#/@officialdakari:extera.xyz) announces

> Hello, everyone! It was a long time we didn't tell anything about Extera. At this moment, we mostly develop Extera Next, a fork of FluffyChat. It contains some fixes and improvements, such as:
> * Use formatting in captions
> * Render HTML in media captions
> * Pure Black theme for AMOLED devices
> * Option to hide avatars in invites
> * Removed accepting by clicking an invite (not in notification tho, also you need to hold the invite to do anything)
> 
> There are not a lot of differences, but the list will grow as time passes.
> 
> You can download Android version of Extera Next from [here](https://extera.xyz/next/next.apk?_twim=2305).

### Element X iOS ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios))

A total rewrite of Element iOS using the Matrix Rust SDK underneath and targeting devices running iOS 16+.

[Mauro Romito](https://matrix.to/#/@mauro.romito:element.io) announces

> * We are improving the media timeline visibility setting, alongside the hide invite avatars by moving them in the account data, so that they might sync across all your devices [(MSC4278)](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4278/files)
> * We have made RC 25.05.2 which includes: 
>   - Tapping on the username in the timeline, will show a bottom sheet to allow admins to swiftly take actions on that user (like kicking or banning).
>   - Timeline events won't be grouped if they happened more than 5 minutes apart.
>   - Fixed a bug that made accepted DMs sometimes appear as group rooms.
>   - Homeserver admins can streamline the onboarding flow with the use of account provisioning deeplinks.

### Tammy ([website](https://tammy.connect2x.de))

Multiplatform messengers build on top of Trixnity Messenger

> We are excited to announce [Element Call v0.11.0](https://github.com/element-hq/element-call/releases/tag/v0.11.0)! 🎉
> 
> Element Call now supports **background blurring** for video feeds! 🌟 This highly requested feature finally made it to Element Call. As one of the most secure video conferencing solutions, this is a must-have because it enhances privacy during calls.
> 
> Additionally, we've fixed a **nasty race-condition** that occurred when unmounting a call. 🐛 The next release candidate is already on the horizon and will include **Earpiece Speaker mode** for mobile use cases. 📱 Stay tuned, and happy calling!

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰

### matrix-rust-sdk ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk))

Next-gen crypto-included SDK for developing Clients, Bots and Appservices; written in Rust with bindings for Node, Swift and WASM

[Ivan 🦀](https://matrix.to/#/@mnt_io:matrix.org) reports

> Oi, mush, rooms everywhere 🍄. Nothing's better than a world-class, UK slang and Matrix based, joke to start a good TWIM. Having immensely enjoyed this dad-ish joke, let's move on what has been done this week in the Matrix Rust SDK!
> 
> ## Timeline
> 
> Refactoring continues to simplify and to refactor the code in order to provide a better support for Threads, mostly around aggregations. Amongst many things:
> 
> * [#5060](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5060) Handle aggregations on non-live timelines: it means that `Timeline`s with a `PinnedEvents` focus (to get the pinned events), or with an `Event` focus (to focus on a permalink), will receive live edits, redactions, or reactions. This was a known limitations, and we are glad to see it being solved. This was necessary for Threads; a happy collateral damage don't you think?
> * [#5059](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5059) The pinned events were unnecessarily reset sometimes, this is now solved so that users get a more stable UI.
> 
> ## Room
> 
> * [#5055](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5055) When sending unthreaded receipts, the unread flag are also unset. It follows [a recommandation from the specification](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.14/client-server-api/#client-behaviour-6) and is expected by most client.
> * [#5070](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5070) `Room` gains two new methods: `successor_room` and `predecessor_room`. When a room A is tombstoned (i.e. archived), it is replaced by a room B. Then room A is the predecessor of B, and B is the successor of A. This is a nice abstraction to better deal with room versions.
> 
> ## Sliding Sync
> 
> * [#5047](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5047) Another excuse to celebrate: the `SlidingSyncRoom` type has finally been removed! It was an awful hack, mostly to store a “timeline buffer”. Now that we have the Event Cache (a novel API to organise and to store events received by a client), and that the Event Cache has a persistent storage, and that the storage is enabled by default (see our last week celebration!), it is now possible to remove this `SlidingSyncRoom` type. What a long path to reach this point, isn't it? Farewell mush.
> 
> ## Cryptography
> 
> * [#4998](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4998) `Client` gains a new superpower: `encrypt_and_send_custom_to_device` to… you guessed it… encrypt and send custom to-device events. It is behind the `experimental-send-custom-to-device` feature flag, so use it at your own risk, it might break at anytime.
> 
> ## General
> 
> The spring clean up continues at a good pace!
> 
> * [#5076](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5076) All our `Cargo.toml` files have been formatted with [`cargo-sort`](https://github.com/DevinR528/cargo-sort/).
> * [#5056](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5056) and [#5067](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5067) The `matrix_sdk_base::rooms::normal` module was almost 4000 LOC. Honestly, not something to brag about. It's now split into smaller modules for the sake of clarity.
> 
> ## Bindings
> 
> Eh, `matrix-sdk-ffi` gains new additions:
> 
> * [#5065](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5065) new superpower unlocked: being able to send the logs in [Sentry](https://sentry.io), which is a nice to have at this level directly, it saves efforts from the apps.
> * [#5058](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5058) it provides a new API to construct a `Timeline`, which helps further improvements. It can break your code though, so please review it.
> * [#5040](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5040) and [#5062](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5062) `matrix-sdk-ffi` receives a couple of new API to get the media preview configuration directly from the store.
> 
> ## Widget
> 
> * [#4963](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4963) One more step towards better encryption support in MatrixRTC with the Matrix Rust SDK: `WidgetDriver` now support to-device events!
