The [Matrix.org](http://Matrix.org) Foundation is happy to announce that the [Matrix Conference 2025](https://2025.matrix.org/) will be held at [Kaleidoscoop](https://www.kaleidos.coop/) in Strasbourg, France, from October 15 to 18!

Last year the Conference was completely sold out, with more than 200 decision makers, experts and enthusiasts joining us for this very first edition! The rooms were so full, and we had such a long waiting list that we've decided to extend our capacity this year to 300 attendees, with flexibility for more.

<!-- more -->

Last year we also received many good proposals that we couldn't fit into our schedule. This year we're adding an extra conference day so we don't miss out on great talks!

* **Wednesday 15 October** will be a BarCamp: an informal workshop-like day where attendees can join, pitch a topic they want to discuss, and vote for topics they have an interest in.  
* **Thursday 16 to Saturday 18 October** will be the three core conference days, with several tracks on topics ranging from Matrix in the Public Sector, Matrix for Sovereignty, Matrix Internals, Governance, and more.

## Call for Proposals

Our [Call for Proposals](https://cfp.2025.matrix.org) is open until June 8, 23:59 CEST. We're looking forward to reading what our community has been working on\! We are open to all speakers but would like to particularly encourage people from groups underrepresented in tech to apply.

## Get Eyes on Your Products

The Matrix Conference is a joyful event where enthusiasm flows between tech people who build the products and decision makers who enable them to do so by purchasing their products and services.

Don't miss out on this opportunity to get the right eyes on your product\! With booths, sponsored tracks, logos on our streams and recordings and much more, this is your chance to advertise  your products and services to the right audience.

Check out the [sponsorship page](https://2025.matrix.org/sponsor/) and [prospectus](https://2025.matrix.org/documents/matrix-conference-sponsors-deck-20250506.pdf) on the Matrix Conference website and reach out rapidly before we run out of packages\!
