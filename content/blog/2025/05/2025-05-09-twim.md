{{youtube_player(video_id="0dRWKVSAh1U")}}

## Dept of elections 🗳️

[Robin Riley (m.org)](https://matrix.to/#/@robinriley:matrix.org) reports

> It's [Governing Board](https://matrix.org/foundation/governing-board/) election season and nominations opened last weekend! This year we're electing representatives for Gold, Silver, Individual, and Associate Members. Learn more on the [2025 election page](https://matrix.org/foundation/governing-board-elections/2025/) and consider nominating yourself! You can also drop by the [Office of the Governing Board](https://matrix.to/#/#governing-board-office:matrix.org) to talk to current representatives and community members.

## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Matrix Authentication Service ([website](https://github.com/element-hq/matrix-authentication-service/))

Matrix Authentication Service (MAS) is an OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Provider server developed by Element.

[Andrew Morgan (anoa) {he/him}](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io) says

> [MAS v0.16.0](https://github.com/element-hq/matrix-authentication-service/releases/tag/v0.16.0) was released this week with a new migration tool! It's still called `syn2mas`, but it's faster, more accurate and... written in Rust. 🦀 Running it against matrix.org showed users being migrated at a rate of 60k/s!
>
> More details around the new tool, and migrating your homeserver to next-generation auth, is [available in the MAS documentation](https://element-hq.github.io/matrix-authentication-service/setup/migration.html). Please give it a try and [send feedback](https://github.com/element-hq/matrix-authentication-service/issues/)!

### Synapse ([website](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/))

Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by Element

[Andrew Morgan (anoa) {he/him}](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io) says

> [Synapse 1.129.0](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/releases/tag/v1.129.0) was released on Tuesday this week. After a rocky start with rc1 a few weeks ago, all regressions have now been fixed. After a successful rc2, v1.129.0 was deemed ready to be finalised.
>
> The release contains some optimisations to token introspection caching when using MAS, as well as some other minor changes. As always, bugs should be reported on the [Synapse issue tracker](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/issues/).

### Conduit ([website](https://conduit.rs))

Conduit is a simple, fast and reliable chat server powered by Matrix

[Matthias](https://matrix.to/#/@matthias:ahouansou.cz) announces

> Conduit [v0.10.0](https://gitlab.com/famedly/conduit/-/releases/v0.10.0) has now released!
>
> I quickly want to note that in case you missed it, a few months ago, I became the lead maintainer
> of Conduit, replacing Timo, as he didn't have the time to commit to the role anymore. He is still
> a member of the project, but now mainly just handles infrastructure, rather than writing code.
>
> This change should allow for more frequent & feature-full, as well as allowing us to accept more
> contributions faster.
>
> Anyways, back onto the release.
>
> The highlight of this release is the media refactor, which include many improvements to media handling, such as:
>
> * De-duplicating identical files
> * Retention policies, to configure how long media is stored for, as well as size limits for scopes of media
> * Commands for blocking and purging media, making it easy to remove media and/or prevent it from being
>   downloaded
>
> And more! See [!740](https://gitlab.com/famedly/conduit/-/merge_requests/740) for an exhaustive list
>
> The other new features added are:
>
> * Support for simplified sliding sync [!744](https://gitlab.com/famedly/conduit/-/merge_requests/744)
> * Appservice pinging [!738](https://gitlab.com/famedly/conduit/-/merge_requests/738)
> * Knocking [!728](https://gitlab.com/famedly/conduit/-/merge_requests/728)
> * Refactoring space handling, allowing remote servers to get space information over federation [!598](https://gitlab.com/famedly/conduit/-/merge_requests/598)
> * Allowing remote servers to leave rooms over federation [!728](https://gitlab.com/famedly/conduit/-/merge_requests/728)
> * Allowing remote servers to join restricted rooms over federation [!618](https://gitlab.com/famedly/conduit/-/merge_requests/618)

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰

### matrix-rust-sdk ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk))

Next-gen crypto-included SDK for developing Clients, Bots and Appservices; written in Rust with bindings for Node, Swift and WASM

[Ivan 🦀](https://matrix.to/#/@mnt_io:matrix.org) reports

> Oh. You're here? Well, you know, we were at the same time busy and in holidays. Anyway. The weekly report gently turns into a monthly report, but who doesn't like long news?
>
> We've spend quite a lot of time doing underground work. Not really visible, but absolutely necessary in order to develop new features.
>
> #### Event cache
>
> We've fixed a `UNIQUE` constraint violation in the SQLite store for the event cache. The SQLite query planner was doing something we were not aware of: the execution order of some updates was happily working by accident sometimes, actually in all our tests, and in most real-life situations. But sometimes it was different, and kaboom. Well, this is now fixed in [#5001](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5001), you can discover how creative we had to be. If someone has a better solution, we welcome it!
>
> Another bug has been fixed where the SDK could believe the start of a timeline has been reached whilst it's wrong, see [#4936](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4936).
>
> #### Notification
>
> Calls and notifications have always been tricky to implement. Hopefully, with [#4991](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4991), we can now check whether a room still has an ongoing call before showing the ringing screen. Rest In Peace dear Bug.
>
> #### Crypto
>
> [Sharing room keys for past messages on invite](https://github.com/element-hq/element-meta/issues/39) is making progress with [#4988](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4988). If we already have cross-signing details for the owner of the device at the point we receive the to-device message, we now store that rather than just the device info.
>
> The `experimental-share-history-on-invite` flag has been introduced in [#4946](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4946/) to share room history when we send an invite. Pretty convenient!
>
> A racy situation has been fixed when collecting devices. When doing so, the pending to-device room key sharing requests are now taken into account. Read the details of the patch to get more details, [#4975](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4975).
>
> We also start using the stable identifier for the sender device keys in [#4964](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4964); the `sender_device_keys` field has been introduced in the MSC4147.
>
> A bug has been fixed where room keys would be rotated unnecessarily in the presence of blacklisted/withheld devices, with [#4954](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4954).
>
> #### Media
>
> Many homeservers expect an encrypted media to be uploaded with the `application/octet-stream` MIME type. The SDK aligns with this behaviour in [#4987](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4987).
>
> #### Threads
>
> We are doing progress about Threads too! The SDK gains new API to list all threads of a room, and the relation events within a thread, go check [#4973](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4973).
>
> We have also been able to open a thread, and paginate its history, inside Element X iOS! The event cache had to be disabled for the moment though. Overall, that's a nice progress! The patches are not sent yet, but it shows we are progressing!
>
> #### SDK maintenance
>
> Refactoring the sync response flow is finished, see [#4914](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4914), [#4925](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4925), [#4928](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4928), [#4934](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4934). Unsurprisingly, it has created a new bug: state events were wrongly reset instead of updated, [#4953](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4953). The good news is that things are now isolated and easier to spot and to fix.
>
> With [#4940](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4940), the room computed display name is now persisted and triggers a notable update. It fixes a long-standing issue where users may not be able to search for a room. Read the patch description to learn more if you are curious about this problem.
>
> #### Conclusion
>
> That's all folks. See you next… week?

## Matrix Federation Stats
