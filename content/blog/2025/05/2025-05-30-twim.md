### Matrix Community Summit 2025

[Yan](https://matrix.to/#/@yan:datanauten.de) says

> **July 31 – August 2 · c-base · Berlin**
> #### Why a Community Summit Matters
> 
> Matrix is more than a protocol – it's a social, technical, and political project.
> It needs places where people can meet, exchange ideas, build software, and strengthen the community.
> 
> In a world increasingly dominated by a few Big Tech players, decentralization is not just a technical feature – it's a necessity.
> A connected planet deserves open protocols, community-driven infrastructure, and people who care about building a better future together.
> #### Who Is It For?
> 
> The Matrix Community Summit is open to:
> 
> - 🧑‍💻 Developers
> - 🧑‍🎨 Designers
> - 🛠️ Admins & Maintainers
> - 📢 Activists
> - 🙋‍♂️ Curious users and power users
> 
> If you work with Matrix – or want to – this is for you. Whether you're presenting a new project, debugging something in person, or dreaming up the next big thing – come and be part of it.
> 
> Join the conversation early in or [**Matrix space**](https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-community-summit-berlin-2025:datanauten.de)!
> #### Looking Back: 2022 & 2023
> 
> In 2022 and 2023, the Matrix Community Summit took place in Berlin as a fully independent, community-organized event – open, experimental, and collaborative.
> We shared ideas, built prototypes, discussed hard problems, and explored the possibilities of federated communication.
> Read some of the [vibe](https://sumnerevans.com/posts/travel/2022-berlin-matrix-summit/summit/).
> #### 2024: Embedded – and now independent again
> 
> In 2024, we were part of the official Matrix Conference – large, professional, inspiring.  
> But in 2025, we're going back to our roots:  
> **No trade fair. No product booths. No audience.**
> 
> Instead, an open and flexible schedule made by the people who show up. Every participant is encouraged to **propose at least one session** – a talk, a workshop, a hackathon, a brainstorm, a walk-and-talk, or anything in between.
> 
> #### Tickets & Swag
> 
> Ticket sales will start soon – we're aiming for **very affordable pricing** to keep the event accessible. While the summit itself runs on volunteer effort, your ticket helps cover **t-shirts, snacks, and drinks throughout the event**.
> 
> Participation in the summit is open, but please **register in advance** so we can plan accordingly. Optional **event t-shirts** will be available on site or via preorder through the [**Matrix room**](https://matrix.to/#/#mcs25-general:datanauten.de).
> 
> Food and drinks will be available at the **c-base**, and we'll organize light communal catering where possible. Contributions welcome!
> 
> #### Format & Sessions
> 
> Sessions can take many forms – from short lightning talks to full-day workshops or all-night hackathons.  
> The venue will be open **24 hours** – ideal for deep dives, spontaneous sessions, or late-night breakthroughs.  
> On **Thursday and Friday**, you’re also welcome to **co-work from the c-base** during the day – so you can get your day job done remotely and still spend your evenings immersed in the Matrix community.
> Please note: **there are no sleeping arrangements on-site**, so plan your accommodation accordingly. See [Sleepover Sync Room](https://matrix.to/#/#mcs25-sleepover-sync:datanauten.de).
> #### Participation & Recording
> 
> Most sessions will **not be recorded** – if you want to take part, you need to be there in person.  
> We do plan to **record a few on-stage discussions and deep dives**, and we're still exploring creative formats to capture the **vibe and message** of MCS25 and beam it out from c-base to the world. Got ideas? Let us know in the [**Matrix room**](https://matrix.to/#/#mcs25-general:datanauten.de)!
> #### Extend Your Experience: Before & After Workations
> 
> Want more time to work and connect with the community?  
> Join our **Matrix Workations** at the **Black Pony Club** in Krems (Austria):
> 
> * **Before the Summit**:  
>     🗓️ _July 19–29_  
>     A relaxed co-living and co-working space to warm up for MCS25.  
>     **Transfer to Berlin** will be organized.
>     
> * **After the Summit**:  
>     🗓️ _August 4–17_  
>     Decompress, code, dream, and build – together.  
>     **Transfer from Berlin** and **to FrOSCon** will be arranged.
>     
> 
> More info and coordination in the [**Matrix room**](https://matrix.to/#/#workation-nation-general:datanauten.de)!
> #### Can't afford to come?
> 
> Try harder 😉  
> If financial reasons are the issue – **get in touch**. We may be able to help.  
> There's a **sleepover coordination room** for couchsurfing and hotel sharing, and we're working to secure some travel budget for community contributors. Reach out to the orga team in the [**Matrix room**](https://matrix.to/#/#mcs25-orga:datanauten.de)!
> #### Can't come at all?
> 
> No worries – we'll be around:  
> Some of us will attend **FrOSCon**, the **Matrix Conference in Strasbourg**, and the **Chaos Communication Congress**.  
> Or reach out to the **Matrix Foundation Events Working Group** – they can help you run your **own local meetup or event**.
> 
> If you're looking for a **conference** focused on **Matrix products, updates from companies and institutions working on and with Matrix**, or want to help **shape how the protocol is used in large organizations, nationwide deployments, or international federations**, please consider attending the [**Matrix Conference in Strasbourg later this year**](https://conference.matrix.org/).
> #### Location: The c-base, Berlin
> 
> We're gathering at the legendary [**c-base**](https://www.c-base.org/) – a space station under Berlin, a hackerspace, a future lab, and a home for radical imagination and technical tinkering.  
> It's the perfect place for federation, open infrastructure, and decentralized dreams.
> #### Participate & Support
> 
> The Matrix Community Summit is **not a commercial event** – there are no booths, no product talks.  
> Instead, we offer **sponsorship packages** for organizations that want to support the event and help keep it grassroots and independent.
> 
> Want to join? Propose a session. Bring your project. Share your knowledge. Let's build together.  
> There is a [pad](https://hedgedoc.sosnowkadub.de/F2SBo-HbRUO75hSnNxfZtw?both) already set for coordination.
> [Next meeting](https://call.element.io/room/#/matrix-community-summit-2025?password=EfJWmmoic3a0i47Apsf_9w&roomId=%21qCPQnXviOiVtFjpiyT%3Acall.ems.host) will be on 6.6. 5pm CEST.
> Coordinate and ask questions in the [**Matrix room**](https://matrix.to/#/#mcs25-orga:datanauten).

## Dept of Spec 📜

[Andrew Morgan (anoa) {he/him}](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io) reports

> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <https://spec.matrix.org/proposals>.
> 
> ### MSC Status
> 
> **New MSCs:**
> * [MSC4294: Ignore and mass ignore invites](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4294)
> * [MSC4293: Redact on ban](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4293)
> * [MSC4292: Handling incompatible room versions in clients](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4292)
> 
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
> * *No MSCs are in FCP.*
> 
> **Accepted MSCs:**
> * *No MSCs were accepted this week.*
> 
> **Closed MSCs:**
> * [MSC2063: Add "server information" public API proposal](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2063)
>     * The underlying git branch ended up being used for another MSC. If anyone wants to revive this MSC, please create a new MSC with the previous branch's contents.
> 
> See the current list of FCPs in proposed final comment period [here](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pulls?q=is%3Aopen%20is%3Apr%20label%3Aproposed-final-comment-period).
> 
> ### Spec Updates
> 
> #### Trust & Safety
> 
> Trust and safety efforts remain high priority for many teams around the ecosystem. This includes the Spec Core Team, where T&S-related MSCs are getting attention off the back of the recent spam waves (apologies for these). This work is actively ongoing in both spec and implementation. If this topic interests you, now is a great time to get involved!
> 
> #### Custom emotes and stickers
> 
> On a lighter tone, it was missed from last week's TWIM as I was away, but [MSC2545: Image Packs (Emoticons & Stickers)](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2545) has finally had final comment period proposed! (It only took five years - that's partially my fault :). Thank you to those who kept poking to get it over the line.
> 
> Care has been taken to keep the functional bits of the MSC the same as the long-implemented version that's been around for years. However, in-progress MSCs are inherently unstable, and there have been a few changes over the last few months that existing implementations should pay attention to.
> 
> Client authors are *highly* recommended to take a look at the current MSC copy. It's been mostly rewritten entirely in the last year (with various slight tweaks to the functionality), so please do read the proposal in full and weigh in on any open threads. Thanks!

## Dept of Clients 📱

### Nheko ([website](https://nheko-reborn.github.io))

Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++17.

[Nico](https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev) announces

> We have been experimenting how to deal with invites. You might want to only receive invites from your friends or you might want to prevent certain servers from inviting you. Alternatively you might just really not get invited to certain rooms.
> 
> For that reason on the development branch of Nheko, you can now either `/allowinvites` or `/blockinvites` to certain rooms or from certain users or servers. You can even tell Nheko to just block everything you didn't explicitly allow. Any blocked invite currently gets rejected immediately without showing up in the UI. An actual graphical interface to manage invite permissions will follow once we settled on an implementation.
> 
> This is in general the same idea as [MSC4155](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4155), but when we implemented it, the format of that MSC didn't really fit our requirements. That MSC now changed its event format, but we haven't revisited if it now is a better fit or not.
> 
> Happy inviting!

### Element X iOS ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios))

A total rewrite of Element iOS using the Matrix Rust SDK underneath and targeting devices running iOS 16+.

[Mauro Romito](https://matrix.to/#/@mauro.romito:element.io) reports

> * Threads works is progressing smoothly!
> * From the next RC the moderation and safety settings will now be recorded on the account data, allowing devices to share that setting
> * We are also updating our internal architecture to use the StateStoreV2 which will provide a safer and more performant way for the UI to update to changes

### Element X Android ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-android))

Android Matrix messenger application using the Matrix Rust SDK and Jetpack Compose.

[Jorge](https://matrix.to/#/@jorgem:element.io) says

> Happy weekend everyone! The week is over and here's our progress on the Element X Android app:
> 
> * Notifications: we've upgrade the UnifiedPush library used in the app, hoping to provide a better support for alternative push clients. Also, we now process and render notifications in batches, which is more efficient and should make the process faster, resulting in smaller delays. This includes ringing call notifications.
> * Proxy: we fixed an issue with the global proxy used in Android, which wasn't correctly setting some of the values in the Matrix Rust SDK, resulting in the client not being able to connect to the homeserver.
> * Login through links: we've added support for logging into some homeserver by following a link.
> * Room loading improvements: we're using a more optimised strategy for loading the timeline of a room, which makes it load faster and fixes an issue which displayed some state events that should have been filtered out as they cause too much noise.
> * Moderation: we're still working on improving the moderation UX in the app.

## Dept of Bots 🤖

### Draupnir ([website](https://github.com/the-draupnir-project/Draupnir))

A moderation bot for open Matrix communities

[Gnuxie 💜🐝](https://matrix.to/#/@gnu_ponut:matrix.org) announces

> [Draupnir v2.3.1](https://github.com/the-draupnir-project/Draupnir/releases/tag/v2.3.1) has been released (via [v2.3.0](https://github.com/the-draupnir-project/Draupnir/releases/tag/v2.3.0)). This update stabilises [a suite of homeserver administrative features](https://the-draupnir-project.github.io/draupnir-documentation/bot/homeserver-administration). Including invitation blocking that is compatible with synapse workers via [synapse-http-antispam](https://the-draupnir-project.github.io/draupnir-documentation/bot/synapse-http-antispam). This replaces the old mjolnir synapse module that requires restarting in order to fetch new policies, and is easily enabled if you are using [MDAD](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/docs/configuring-playbook-bot-draupnir.md#enabling-synapse-http-antispam-support).
> 
> Additionally it is also possible to retroactively reject invitations on behalf of resident users via room takedowns sourced from watched policy lists. And resident users can be automatically suspended and unsuspended based on your policy list subscriptions too. Which is very handy for homeservers that have public registration. Please read the [homeserver admin overview](https://the-draupnir-project.github.io/draupnir-documentation/bot/homeserver-administration) and [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/the-draupnir-project/Draupnir/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v231---2025-05-29) for all the details. And also checkout the new search feature in the [draupnir documentation](https://the-draupnir-project.github.io/draupnir-documentation/) contributed by [Cat](https://matrix.to/#/@cat:feline.support). We'll see you in [#draupnir:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#draupnir:matrix.org)!

## Dept of Interesting Projects 🛰️
