You might have seen our [earlier post](@blog/2025/11/2025-11-04-fosdem-cfp.md) about the Decentralised Communication Devroom we are coordinating. This is one of the exciting ways to come talk to us, but it's not the only one!

This year we're organising a **hackathon** before FOSDEM, we'll have a **booth** during FOSDEM itself, and we're coordinating the Decentralised Communication **devroom**!

## Friday, 30th January - Community Hackathon & Lounge Evening

Would it be FOSDEM if it didn't start with our traditional Matrix Community Event on Friday? This time, we will be organizing a collaborative hackathon for the **full day**, starting at 9:00 CET. Don't be late: we'll use the first hour to select tasks and form teams!

The Matrix ecosystem is all about lifting everyone through federation and interoperability. That's why in this Hackathon for the Community, we will not compete for the best project, but we will have a joint mission: The Matrix Federation is endangered by Big Silo trying to control our minds, and we can fight back!

The mighty scientists funded by our sponsors helped us develop Brain Protection Caps. They shipped a crate with the caps, and tried to send us the combination of the lock on Matrix. Unfortunately, their server went down before they could send the message! To crack the combination we need to level up our skills and fill our collective experience bar by collaborating on hackathon projects.

During the first hour, people will list what they want to work on, and form teams on the spot. Every project helps us fill our experience bar. Our skills increase when we work on *anything* related to Matrix.

Code, project management, art, documentation: every contribution will earn you Achievements that will fill our collective experience bar! Let’s strive to unlock the Matrix caps by mentoring each other, hacking on new ideas and bonding together as a community.

The hackathon is first and foremost about having fun and learning. We want to know what you worked on, what worked, what you struggled with, and what surprised you. We'll conclude the day by asking teams to summarize their day to others. We would like to livestream the sessions on our website, but you can opt-out if you're not comfortable with it.

After the project presentations, we will stay in HSBXL in the evening for a public Matrix Lounge Evening. We're inviting the entire Matrix community to spend a relaxed evening with food, drinks and interesting discussions about Matrix! We're asking all hackathon attendees to [register](https://pretix.eu/matrix/fosdem26-hackathon/) so we can best organize the event.

## Saturday, 31st January & Sunday, 1st February - Booth

Once more, we are grateful to the FOSDEM organizers for granting us a booth for the whole weekend! If you want to come talk to the team, share your gripes and ideas or come see cool demos, this is your opportunity to do so! We will bring merch and stickers for the community to help us spread the word.

We're looking for volunteers to run the booth with us. This includes talking to the community, sharing project news, and distributing merch. Don't worry if it's your first time: We have a booth handbook ready for volunteers and want to limit the time commitment to 2 hours per day.

Reach out to <events-wg@foundation.matrix.org> or in [#events-wg:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#events-wg:matrix.org) if you're interested in staffing the booth with us! We will work out together which slot works best for you.

🕐️ Saturday 1 to Sunday 2, 09:00 - 18:00 CET (local time)  
🏢 Desk to be announced [on FOSDEM's website](https://fosdem.org/2026/stands/)

## Sunday, 1st February - Devroom

This year FOSDEM organisers tried to accommodate as many projects as possible by asking devroom managers to focus on themes more than on specific projects. They generously granted us a full day devroom on Sunday, 1st February, to talk about Decentralised Communication, and we're delighted to have received so many proposals!

![A room full of people are listening to a speaker who is off the frame.](/blog/img/fosdem25-devroom.webp)

We're rating which talks we think are the most interesting for the Decentralised Communications community, and will finalize a schedule by 15th December. We're looking forward to meeting people from the various decentralised communication communities, exchanging ideas, and seeing how we can collaborate more!
