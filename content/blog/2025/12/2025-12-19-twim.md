## Dept of Trust & Safety ⚖️

### Introducing policyserv

[Jim](https://matrix.to/#/@mackesque:matrix.org) announces

> Hello from the Trust & Safety team! [Earlier this week](https://matrix.org/blog/2025/12/policyserv/) we revealed that we're open-sourcing the implementation of policy servers we use to protect rooms like TWIM.
> 
> Please:

> - poke around the code
> - deploy your own
> - [sign up to use our policy server to protect your rooms](https://github.com/matrix-org/policyserv-setup-bot?tab=readme-ov-file#usage)
> - [send us](https://github.com/matrix-org/policyserv/issues) bug reports, feature requests and (ideally) pull requests
> 
> Join us in the new #policyserv:matrix.org room for more!

## Dept of Servers 🏢
  
### Synapse ([website](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/))

Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by Element.

[Andrew Morgan (anoa) {he/him}](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io) reports

> We're pausing our regular releases for the holiday season. Expect them to start back up again in early January with a 1.145.0rc1.

## Homeserver Deployment 📥️
  
### Element Server Suite ([website](https://element.io/server-suite))

Element Server Suite (ESS) is a backend hosting solution for Matrix-based communications that supports self-hosted and fully managed deployments.

[Ben BZ](https://matrix.to/#/@ben:banzan.uk) announces

> **ESS Community [25.12.2](https://github.com/element-hq/ess-helm/releases/tag/25.12.2), ESS Pro [25.12.2](https://docs.element.io/latest/element-server-suite-pro/release-notes/#ess-pro-25121-2025-12-12), 25.10.4 & 25.4.15 Security Releases**
> 
> ESS has released a set of critical security updates to address an issue (tracked as `ELEMENTSEC-2025-1670`) affecting all versions of ESS Community and ESS Pro. ESS Classic and other Synapse-based deployments are not affected. ESS Community `25.12.2`, ESS Pro `25.12.2`, ESS Pro `25.10.4` LTS, and ESS Pro `25.4.15` LTS or later all contain the fix.
> 
> The issue only has an impact when federation APIs are exposed to an untrusted network. Deployments that are not currently federating, or that only federate in a closed, trusted federation, are not impacted. These deployments should not enable public federation without first applying this update.
> 
> We advise you to apply the update as quickly as possible; apologies for the bad timing of the release given the holiday season.

## Dept of Clients 📱
  
### Element X iOS ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios))

A total rewrite of Element iOS using the Matrix Rust SDK underneath and targeting devices running iOS 17+.

[Mauro Romito](https://matrix.to/#/@mauro.romito:element.io) reports

> - Spaces Feature - Massive effort to build comprehensive space support (discovery, exploration, settings, members management)
> - Security & Verification - User verification requests, identity pinning, encryption authenticity warnings
> - Experimental Threads Support - Support for threaded messaging with drafts, media, proper rendering and permalinking
> - Design Refinements - Continuous UI/UX improvements across the app, redesigned various screen to make the UI look great, and the UX simple.
> - iOS 26 Liquid Glass - Support for latest iOS version and a UI that is responsive to the new liquid glass interface.
> - Performance & Quality - Regular bug fixes and SDK updates, various features like event caching were enabled to keep EX as the fastest Element client ever.
> - Accessibility - Accessibility has become a key feature of the app, and a framework to regularly test it has been built to ensure that the app is always provide an accessible UX.
> - Room pills - Now also room permalinks are pillified, a great way to both show clearly were the permalinks is leading to, but also detect if such permalinks is valid, or a phishing attempt.
> - Moderation Tools - User reporting, blocking, banning capabilities, and the possibility of turning on and off media previews or invite avatars to protect yourself from offensive content.
> 
> This was a very productive year focusing on collaborative features (spaces), security, and bringing the app up to modern iOS standards!

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰
  
### matrix-rust-sdk ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk))

Your all-in-one toolkit for creating Matrix clients with Rust, from simple bots to full-featured apps, with bindings to Swift, Kotlin, WebAssembly, Go and more, sponsored by Element.

[Ivan 🦀](https://matrix.to/#/@mnt_io:matrix.org) announces

> _Bonjour_ everyone! Winter is about to become official here. Sun has entered sleepy mode. And most of the team is about to do the same. Here are the last new features or bug fixes for this year, but before, a note.
> 
> We would like to thank you for all your support, your great patches, your great comments, your patience, and your encouragement. It warms our heart and that's what drives us daily. You're the reason we are working every day. Please keep pushing Matrix forwards, the world needs a better communication platform more than ever.
> 
> #### Threads
> 
> Next year will start with a deeper focus on Threads to have persistent storage and much more. For the moment, we had a single new feature.
> 
> - [#5848](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5848) Thread subscription updates are bundled, improving the stress on the stores.
> 
> #### Latest Event
> 
> The Latest Event is more stable than ever, and we believe the project is finished. Enjoy it!
> 
> - [#5932](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5932) Redacted and redaction events are now handled in a more expected way. Redacted events are no longer displayed as a Latest Event, even as “Message removed”.
> - [#5938](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5938) The Latest Event wasn't supporting “high-traffic”/pressure very well because the channels were too small. It's now fixed.
> - [#5947](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5947) The Latest Event API is lazier, make it more resilient to asynchronous edge cases.
> - [#5968](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5968) Sometimes a local Latest Event was in a sending mode, and was never exiting this mode despite the event was sent! We call them “sticky”. This problem had its roots in asynchronous runtime craziness, and was quite random, but it's now fully fixed.
> - [#5969](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5969) and [#5977](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5977) These patches better define “erasable” Latest Event values, to handle with confidence the redaction of events.
> 
> #### Event Cache
> 
> The Event Cache has a new superpower: R2D2. It's the funny name for the Redecryption API. It now better supports key backups and is able to automatically redecrypts in-memory events when needed. It's fully automatic and all API relying on the Event Cache will benefit from it.
> 
> - [#5961](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5961) Let R2D2 listens to key backup state changes, and report when a backup becomes available.
> - [#5976](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5976) Let R2D2 redecrypts and updates encryption info of in-memory events automatically.
> 
> #### Send Queue
> 
> The Send Queue is the API responsible to send events. Now it talks with the Event Cache.
> 
> - [#5936](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5936) Do you remember last week when we announced the Send Queue is saving the sent events directly inside the Event Cache? Well, it came with a bug. This is the fix: the encryption information are correctly inferred.
> 
> #### IndexedDB support
> 
> - [#5933](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5933) Encrypted stores are now fully supported for IndexedDB, fixing bugs for the Event Cache and the Media stores.
> - [#5946](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5946) All stores (State, Event Cache, Media, and Crypto) are all exposed to IndexedDB \o/.
> 
> #### Crypto
> 
> - [#5955](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5955) Allow a focused Timeline to replace UTD (Unable To Decrypt) after redecryption.
> - [#5943](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5943) Add `forwarder_data` to `InboundGroupSession` and pickle.
> - [#5970](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5970) Fix bug in `TimelineEvent::from_bundled_latest_event` where the `session_id` was erased.

### Matrix Community Workation 2026 · Asia Edition

[Yan 't' Minagawa](https://matrix.to/#/@yan:datanauten.de) says

> This week we shared the outline for the **Matrix Workation 2026 (Asia Edition)** - a community-focused workation bringing Matrix people together across the world.
> 
> #### What’s planned
> 
> * **Jan 30 – Feb 1:** Matrix Hackathon & FOSDEM in Brussels
> * **Feb 3 – Mar 6:** Matrix Workation on **Koh Phangan, Thailand**, with flexible participation across multiple periods
> * **Mar 9 - Mar 10:** represent Matrix at the FOSSASIA in Bangkok
> * **From mid-March:** Optional continuation with community coworking in **Hoi An, Vietnam**
> 
> #### How it works
> 
> * Shared costs (accommodation, coworking, scooters) are pooled at roughly **€60 per person per day**, with full transparency via a shared CryptPad
> * Participation is possible per period or as a longer stay
> * A gentle daily rhythm: light mornings, a shared working window **11:00–17:00**, daily syncs, and async-friendly collaboration across time zones
> 
> #### Why Koh Phangan
> Koh Phangan offers a rare combination of calm, nature, and reliable infrastructure. Surrounded by jungle, beaches, and waterfalls, it’s an ideal place to slow down, think clearly, and share knowledge. Between focused work sessions, the island invites movement and connection — swimming, hiking, yoga, Muay Thai, local food markets, shared meals, and long conversations at sunset.
> 
> **Goals**
> 
> * Share Matrix knowledge, experiences, and best practices in a relaxed, human-scale setting
> * Create space for learning, mentoring, and cross-project exchange
> * Combine meaningful collaboration with the asian based matrix community
> 
> **Links**
