## Dept of Spec 📜

[Andrew Morgan (anoa) {he/him}](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io) says

> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <https://spec.matrix.org/proposals>.
> 
> ### MSC Status
> 
> **New MSCs:**
> 
> - [MSC4388: Secure out-of-band channel for sign in with QR](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4388)
> - [MSC4387: `M_SAFETY` error code](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4387)
> - [MSC4386: Automatically sharing secrets after device verification](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4386)
> 
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
> 
> - _No MSCs are in FCP._
> 
> **Accepted MSCs:**
> 
> - _No MSCs were accepted this week._
> 
> **Closed MSCs:**
> 
> - [MSC4124: Simple Server Authorization](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4124)
>     - Superseded by [MSC4345: Server key identity and room membership](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4345).
> - [MSC4099: Participation based authorization for servers in the Matrix DAG](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4099)
>     - Superseded by [MSC4345: Server key identity and room membership](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4345).
> - [MSC3953: Server capability DAG](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3953)
>     - Superseded by [MSC4345: Server key identity and room membership](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4345).

>     - Superseded by [MSC4155: Invite Filtering](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4155)
> 
> ### Spec Updates
> 
> The Spec Core Team expects to release Matrix v1.17 next week with a few MSCs, along with some improvements to the spec website. Stay tuned for those!
> 
> Otherwise we're still working away at Matrix 2.0 MSCs - trying to keep them at the forefront while occasionally dipping into other MSCs. [MSC4143: MatrixRTC](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4143), [MSC4354: Sticky Events](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4354) and [MSC4186: Simplified Sliding Sync](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4186) are the three currently being most actively worked on. The team appreciates your patience while the details are being hammered out.

> - Delayed event timeouts can now be restarted from workers. [#19207](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/issues/19207)
> 
> ... and a whole lot more!
> 
> Thank you to all our contributors for helping to make Synapse the best it can be.
> As always, feel free to stop by [#synapse:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#synapse:matrix.org) to join in on the discussion and if you encounter a bug make sure to report it [here](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/issues/new/choose).

## Homeserver Deployment 📥️
  
### Element Server Suite ([website](https://element.io/server-suite))

Element Server Suite (ESS) is a backend hosting solution for Matrix-based communications that supports self-hosted and fully managed deployments.

[Gaël G.](https://matrix.to/#/@gaelg:element.io) says

> **[ESS Community 25.12.1](https://github.com/element-hq/ess-helm/releases/tag/25.12.1) and [ESS Pro 25.12.1](https://docs.element.io/latest/element-server-suite-pro/release-notes/) have been released!**
> 
> Both bring in upgrades of Synapse to v1.144.0, Matrix Authentication Service to v1.8.0 & Element Admin v0.1.10.
> Support for IPv4, IPv6 only or dual-stack clusters is now complete!

## Dept of Clients 📱

### Extera Next

[OfficialDakari](https://matrix.to/#/@officialdakari:extera.xyz) reports

> After a long time, a new update of Extera Next finally arrives! We also decided to change our versioning scheme, so now it's 25.1.0.
> 
> #### What's new?
> 
> - Brought back calls. They should work, just enable experimental video calls. Keep in mind that VoIP is still in beta! Also fixed screen sharing.
> - Incoming calls now use system ringtone!
> - Background downloads were a part of Extera since 2.1.0. And today, we are bringing them to Linux version!
> - Removed chat filters, we replaced them with bottom navigation bar. Well, we just moved chat filters to navbar.
> - Some fixes for polls: They are now visible to other clients.
> - Revamped UI: room emote settings and user profile view.
> - "About yourself" field. Now you can tell the world about yourself, remember to fit that into 256 characters tho. We used custom profile fields, this one is `xyz.extera.about`, a string field.
> - Fixed search query leaking: Now you need to press Enter to start a global search.
> - Some simple QoL changes: read receipts dialog and copying links to messages.
> 
> That's all for this update. You can already download binaries on [our website](https://extera.xyz/)!
  
### Element X iOS ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios))

A total rewrite of Element iOS using the Matrix Rust SDK underneath and targeting devices running iOS 17+.

[Mauro Romito](https://matrix.to/#/@mauro.romito:element.io) announces

> - Solved a bug that slowed down or made unreliable the room list
> - On the spaces side the space settings work is pretty much complete and in QA
> - We also added the ability to set the restricted and knock restricted space settings to a room/space, and provide a list of allowed spaces (such spaces` members won't need to be invited or knock the room to join it)
> - We started working on linking another device through QR, which will allow EXI to generate a qr code that when scanned by another device, will allow an automatic verified login.
> - However such feature will also work with EW, but the QR code is generated by EW, and scanned by EXI, allowing a seamless automatic verified login on EW.
> - We are experimenting with the idea of bringing spaces in the room list, and how to best visualise them to provide the best possible UX

## Dept of Bots 🤖

[morethanabitoff](https://matrix.to/#/@morethanabitoff:matrix.org) announces

> I created two new matrix chat bots to help support the Northern Virginia Linux Users Group, but they are general enough that others could find them useful:
> 
> * A general help bot that also sends messages to people on joins. <https://github.com/anewton1998/matrix-bot-help>
> * An iCal reminder bot, responds to !meeting and also sends periodic reminders: <https://github.com/anewton1998/matrix-bot-ical>
> 
> Both written in Rust using the very sweet [matrix-rust-sdk](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk).
