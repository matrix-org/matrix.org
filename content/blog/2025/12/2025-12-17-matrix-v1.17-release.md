Hey all,

At this year’s Matrix Conference [we said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y8qtRLgalQ&t=744s) we were aiming for this very spec release to be 2.0 proper. It looks like the MSCs still need a little bit more time to get over the line though, but they’re extremely close — one of the next few releases is expected to be Matrix 2.0.

Today we’re releasing [Matrix 1.17](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.17) while the 2.0 MSCs continue to make forward progress. This release is smaller than some, with four MSCs merged, but as normal also includes a number of clarifications.

[Improvements to the spec website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Axa0Kw3XPI?t=879) include a dropdown to get at old spec versions more easily, and an index of HTTP endpoints at the top of each page.

This release of the spec also sees the incorporation of the specifications for the [Olm and Megolm cryptographic ratchets](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.17/olm-megolm). Olm and Megolm themselves haven’t changed, but we did want them to be on the spec site :)

Thanks especially to Johannes and Kévin for continuing to improve the quality of the spec with features, clarifications, and MSC text!
