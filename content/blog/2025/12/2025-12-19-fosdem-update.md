As we've [previously announced](@/blog/2025/12/2025-12-03-fosdem-presence.md), we are organising a Matrix Hackathon before FOSDEM and co-organising the Decentralised Communication Devroom. We have updates for you!

## Devroom line-up

We finalised and published the schedule of the Devroom. We're pleased to announce that the devroom will feature talks about Trust & Safety in the context of decentralised systems, Matrix, XMPP, ActivityPub, AT, DASL, KERI, and even a talk about how to onboard more people. When combing the proposals, we tried to get as many relevant technologies covered as possible.

You can find the [Devroom schedule](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/track/decentralised-communication/) on FOSDEM's website.

🕐️ Sunday 1, 09:00 - 17:00 CET (local time)  
🏢 Room aw1126

## Hackathon

We're organising a hackathon on Friday, 30 January, at HSBXL. It is a collaborative hackathon where everyone can come hack on what they want. Don't be afraid to come: we already have experienced community members who signed up and who are keen on mentoring newcomers!

The following topics are covered by mentors who already signed up and volunteered to help steer others in the right direction:

- [Synapse](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse): Mathieu, Olivier
- Rust apps: Mathieu
- Trust & Safety, [Draupnir](https://github.com/the-draupnir-project/Draupnir): Gnuxie

- [Element Web](https://github.com/element-hq/element-web): Dave, Florian
- MatrixRTC: Timo, Td, Valere
- Encryption: Valere, Hubert
- [Matrix-Auth-Service](https://github.com/element-hq/matrix-authentication-service): Quentin
- [Nheko](https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko): Nico
- [Neoboard](https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-neoboard): Milton

If you want to mentor or hack on another topic you're of course also welcome to the hackathon.

The schedule is the following:

- 09:00 - Welcome, brainstorming on project ideas
- 10:00 - Teams are formed and start working on their project
- 12:00 - Lunch delivery
- 17:00 - End of the project phase. Groups present what they did or couldn't do
- 18:00 - Evening Lounge
- 19:30 - Dinner delivery
- 21:30 - End of the Evening Lounge

Between 09:00 and 17:00 we will keep the space focused on the hackathon, with a backstory to galvanise contributors! After 17:00 the hacking phase of the hackathon will be over, and everyone will be welcome to attend and join us for the evening.
