## Dept of *Status of Matrix* 🌡️

### Governing Board ([website](https://matrix.org/foundation/governing-board/))

The Governing Board is an advisory board that is made up of elected representatives from all across the Matrix ecosystem.

[Gwmngilfen](https://matrix.to/#/@gwmngilfen:matrix.org) reports

> A [few weeks ago](https://matrix.org/blog/2025/02/21/this-week-in-matrix-2025-02-21/#new-gb-working-groups-call-for-members) the Governing Board brought you news of a Working Group process, and the first ones had been proposed using it. I'm happy to report that we now have our first two active Working Groups!
>
> #### New Groups
>
> Firstly, we have the Website Working Group, which (from their charter) has "responsibility for editorial and technical oversight of the main Matrix websites and social media channels.
> This includes the main matrix.org website, conference website, and the various social media channels". They've already had their first meetings, and you can find them in [#matrix.org-website:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#matrix.org-website:matrix.org)
>
> Secondly, we have the Events Working Group, which (again from the charter) is "the main organising team of the official events hosted by the Foundation, such as the Matrix Conference or co-hosting FOSDEM Fringe". They are just spinning up their processes, and you can find them in [#events-wg:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#events-wg:matrix.org)
>
> #### More Groups Wanted
>
> We want to see many more groups! We have a couple of new groups under consideration by the Board which I hope to bring you news of soon, but in the meantime, discussion and/or volunteering for potential new groups is very welcome in [#governing-board-office:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#governing-board-office:matrix.org) ! (And yes, I still want to get the Docs and UX groups running, speak to me in that room if you wish to volunteer 😛)
>
> Thanks for your efforts & work, on behalf of your Governing Board!

## Department of website updates 🌐

### Matrix.org Website Content and Contribution Documentation update

[MTRNord (they/them)](https://matrix.to/#/@mtrnord:midnightthoughts.space) announces

> For the people contributing to the matrix.org website, we had some longer standing questions about how to contribute and how our templates work. We finally got around after a little over a year of iteration to merging these documentations to our repository.
>
> To give a short overview of the changes we made:
>
> * The CONTRIBUTING.md
>   * now mentions our mission and target groups of the website
>   * mentions how we measure progress on changes
>   * Documents how we take decisions on content
>   * was changed that we require PRs for changes to the website (though we leave some slack to this process where it makes sense)
> * The CONTENT.md - It is a whole new document about how you write content. You want to write a Blog post, a Documentation page, or add things to the ecosystem? You find this information here.
>
> You can find both files in the root of our repo or at <https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md> and <https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/blob/main/CONTENT.md>
>
> In case of feedback or unclear things, please open an issue in the repo at <https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/issues/new> :)

### Governing Board and Working Group Pages added to the website

[MTRNord (they/them)](https://matrix.to/#/@mtrnord:midnightthoughts.space) says

> This week, the Matrix.org website has seen two important updates. As part of our ongoing work to improve the site's content, we've added two new pages that provide more details on the governance and organizational structure of Matrix.
>
> The first update is the new [Governing Board Page](https://matrix.org/foundation/governing-board/), which outlines the members of the Governing Board and the processes involved in its operations. This page serves as a resource for those interested in learning more about the governance of Matrix.org.
>
> The second addition is the [Working Groups Page](https://matrix.org/foundation/working-groups/), which lists the various working groups within the Matrix community. On this page, you'll find information about each group's mission and matrix room.
>
> As usual, you can report errors on <https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org> or reach the website working group in #matrix.org-website:matrix.org .

## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Synapse ([website](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/))

Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by Element

[Andrew Morgan (anoa) {he/him}](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io) announces

> ### Synapse
>
> Hello everyone! This week the Element team released [Synapse v1.126.0](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/releases/tag/v1.126.0) with some minor new features and many bug fixes. Important things to note are:
>
> * By default, only server admins may add a room to a homeserver's public rooms list.
> * The expiry date of the signing key used to sign Synapse's debian packages was recently renewed. The old key is due to expire tomorrow, March 15th, 2025. If you have not updated your local copy of the key, you may experience issues with upgrading Synapse after this date. For most users, a simple `apt-get upgrade` should suffice.
>
> Read more about both topics [in the upgrade notes](https://element-hq.github.io/synapse/latest/upgrade.html#upgrading-to-v11260). Thanks!

## Dept of Clients 📱

### Element X iOS ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios))

A total rewrite of Element-iOS using the Matrix Rust SDK underneath and targeting devices running iOS 16+.

[Doug](https://matrix.to/#/@douge:matrix.org) says

> [@this-week-in:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/@this-week-in:matrix.org)
>
> ### Element X iOS
>
> This week we’ve been monitoring the TestFlight of version 25.03.2 which is our first build of the app with Rust’s event cache enabled. There have been numerous fixes in the SDK following all of the feedback we received and we’re planning to make a second TestFlight next week with all of these fixes incorporated.
>
> Other than that we discovered an issue in the Notification extension causing it to exceed it’s memory limit (a generous 24MB), and we’ve started work on the detection of potentially malicious links being included in a formatted message.
>
> And let’s sneak a small update on the classic Element iOS app into this post: The project has been updated to support Xcode 16, which hopefully will be the last time the app needs to switch Xcode versions 🤞

## Dept of VoIP 🤙

### Element Call ([website](https://call.element.io))

Native Decentralised End-to-end Encrypted Group Calls in Matrix, as a standalone web app

[Florian Heese](https://matrix.to/#/@fheese:element.io) says

> **🔊 VoIP Updates: Element Call News!**
>
> Hey Matrix community! The VoIP team has some exciting updates on **Element Call**:
>
> **📖 New README & Self-Hosting Guide**
>
> We've updated the [README](https://github.com/element-hq/element-call/blob/livekit/README.md) to better explain **Standalone vs. Widget/In-App mode** in Element Call and how calls work over federation. Alongside, we've also refreshed the **[self-hosting guide](https://github.com/element-hq/element-call/blob/livekit/docs/self-hosting.md)** to help you set up your own instance.
>
> **📦 New Bundling Mechanism for In-App use-case**
>
> A new bundling approach is coming to ensure **Element Call Widget is included directly in Messenger App bundles**. Planned rollout dates:
>
> * **Element X** -- 2025-03-31
> * **Element Web & Desktop** -- 2025-04-08
>
> ⚠️**Heads-Up: Removal of fallback MatrixRTC backend**
>
> Currently, the default Element Call widget at [call.element.io](https://call.element.io/) provides a **fallback MatrixRTC backend** (sponsored by Element) that helps in cases where a Matrix deployment lacks its own MatrixRTC backend.
>
> With the move to In-App bundling, we plan to **sunset this fallback soon**. If you rely on this fallback, please follow the **[self-hosting guide](https://github.com/element-hq/element-call/blob/livekit/docs/self-hosting.md)** to ensure your site deployment supports **MatrixRTC/Element Call** properly.
>
> Stay tuned for more updates, and as always, happy hacking! 🚀

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰

### matrix-rust-sdk ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk))

Next-gen crypto-included SDK for developing Clients, Bots and Appservices; written in Rust with bindings for Node, Swift and WASM

[Ivan 🦀](https://matrix.to/#/@mnt_io:matrix.org) reports

> ### matrix-rust-sdk
>
> Several people are on a mission! We are ~pretty~ extremely busy running after each minute of the day to track the last bugs in the Event Cache. Meanwhile, the memory usage and the performance are being improved greatly in the Event Cache and in the Timeline. Also, great progresses are being made in OIDC and in the bindings. Finally, your regular dose of robustness in the crypto layer. Let's dig in together, it's an exciting time!
>
> #### Event Cache
>
> The Event Cache (`matrix_sdk::event_cache`) is a new API that stores all your events. It now supports lazy-loading, and thus provides an improved offline support, but also a much faster user experience. Before adding more features, we are tackling the last bugs. And, oh, how nasty they are. We can group the patches in a couple of categories.
>
> Ensuring lazy-loading works everywhere:
>
> * Wait for the initial previous-batch token ([#4724](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4724))
> * `event` looks inside the store ([#4708](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4708))
> * Duplicated events are always removed ([#4706](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4706))
>
> Ensuring we don't miss events and we resolve gaps during syncs or backwards paginations correctly:
>
> * Don't remove a gap when it's the only chunk in memory ([#4779](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4779))
> * Deduplicate events with the cache when they are received from a backwards pagination ([#4748](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4748))
> * Remove an empty events chunk after pushing a gap in sync ([#4734](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4734))
> * Consolidate the logic around retrieving the latest gap ([#4733](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4733))
> * Call `/messages` directly in the room pagination ([#4731](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4731))
>
> A new super-power: a `RoomEventCache` automatically shrinks itself when no more subscribers are listening to it. It frees memory, your device says thank *you*:
>
> * Automatically shrink a room's linked chunk when all subscribers are gone ([#4703](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4703))
> * Unload a linked chunk whenever we get a limited sync ([#4694](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4694))
>
> #### Timeline
>
> The Timeline (`matrix_sdk_ui::timeline`) receives its prize too. It is now able to re-decrypt Unable To Decrypt (UTD) received by the Event Cache. (The decryption module will move into the Event Cache later). Another bug was fixed where too many read receipts were set on too many messages.
>
> * Decrypt `TimelineEventKind::UnableToDecrypt` coming from the event cache ([#4794](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4794))
> * Adjust the event origins in the `Timeline` and the `EventCache` ([#4795](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4795))
> * Don't duplicate read receipts of hidden events after a pagination ([#4749](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4749))
>
> #### Memory usage and Performance
>
> Old devices? Low-end devices? You're in our hearts and you're not forgotten! A couple of patches improve the performance and reduce the memory usage greatly!
>
> * The memory usage of a `Client` has been reduced by a factor of 65'536 times ([#4787](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4787), [#4799](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4799))
> * `SqliteEventCacheStore` is 35 times faster, yup, you read it well ([#4739](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4739))
>
> #### Rooms
>
> Matrix is about events and rooms right? Rooms have been improved!
>
> * If [MSC3266](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3266) isn't implemented on your homeserver, invites room summary now fallbacks to another mechanism to fetch all the needed data ([#4780](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4780))
> * A new `EncryptionState` type has been defined, it helps to clarify the 3 possible encryption states: `Encrypted`, `NotEncrypted` and `Unknown` ([#4777](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4777))
> * Always know when a room is encrypted or not (with sliding sync); It saves calls to `/state/m.room.encryption`, thus providing faster feedback when opening a room or showing a notification ([#4778](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4778))
>
> #### Crypto
>
> Crypto is relentlessly improving, making it more and more robust everyday! Who said decentralized end-to-end encryption was easy?
>
> * Redecrypt non-UTD messages to remove no-longer-relevant warning shields ([#4644](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4644))
> * Retry decryption from a long-lived async task, instead of lots of detached ones ([#4715](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4715))
> * Add support for the shared history flag defined in [MSC3061](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3061) ([#4700](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4700))
> * Use the `DecryptedOlmV1Event` when encrypting to-device events ([#4690](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4690))
>
> #### OIDC
>
> Someone is putting OIDC on a rocket. We have a lift-off!
>
> * Align logout behavior with [MSC4254](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4254) ([#4674](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4674))
> * Merge session tokens ([#4772](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4772))
> * Improvements to `url_for_oidc` ([#4771](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4771))
> * Match the proper error type for invalid refresh token ([#4767](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4767))
> * Use oauth2 for token revocation ([#4763](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4763))
> * Start replacing `mas-oidc-client` with oauth2 ([#4761](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4761))
> * Run integration tests for `experimental-oidc` feature too ([#4727](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4727))
> * Align `OidcAuthCodeUrlBuilder` behavior with next-gen auth MSCs ([#4699](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4699))
>
> #### Refactoring
>
> Because refactoring is part of the live-cycle of a project:
>
> * Extract `TimelineBuilder` tasks into their own functions ([#4796](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4796))
>
> #### Bindings
>
> The bindings have been improved greatly too! First off, all the `block_on` calls have been removed, and the Tokio runtime starts fewer threads and blocking threads, thus reducing the memory usage again:
>
> * New way to provide a lightweight tokio runtime for memory-constrained apps ([#4766](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4766))
> * Rename `setup_tracing` into `init_platform` ([#4790](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4790))
> * Remove useless `block_on` ([#4757](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4757))
>
> Do you remember the new media retention policy? Now it's available for the bindings!
>
> * Allow clearing all the non-critical caches + set a media retention policy ([#4745](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4745))
>
> Finally, OIDC updates and room updates as seen above:
>
> * Restore some needed OIDC prompts in the FFI layer ([#4791](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4791))
> * Add `RoomInfo::encryption_state` ([#4788](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4788))
> * Remove `Room::is_encrypted` ([#4786](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4786))
> * Unify a bit more `Room::timeline_with_configuration` and `RoomListItem::init_timeline` ([#4735](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4735))
>
> #### Misc
>
> Multiverse, our tiny terminal debug-oriented Matrix client, is receiving some love:
>
> * Support passing a server URL ([#4797](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4797))
> * Many small clean ups ([#4764](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4764))
> * Don't wait for sync service state changes when shutting down ([#4765](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4765))
>
> Finally, the Matrix Rust SDK is faster to build in release mode with LTO disabled:
>
> * Disable LTO on release builds ([#4751](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4751))
>
> #### Good Luck Ben
>
> We say *good luck* to Benjamin for his talk at [Rust in Paris](https://www.rustinparis.com/schedule) about *How To Compile Rust Code Faster: Compiler 101*. It's today!
