Hey all,

We're right at the end of Q1 2025 with a new spec release: [Matrix 1.14](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.14/)! Our [original plan](https://matrix.org/blog/2024/12/19/matrix-v1.13-release/) was to cut this release around FOSDEM with some Matrix 2.0 functionality, but ended up needing to push the release out due to those MSCs not quite being ready. As we're cutting this release though, several of the Next Generation Authentication MSCs are progressing through FCP and could do with a release once written up as spec PRs. We anticipate that Matrix 1.15 will be that release, and go out early in Q2 2025.

This release brings just 3 MSCs to the world, largely because the SCT has been focusing so much on Matrix 2.0 objectives. The only feature introduced is the [report user endpoint](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.14/client-server-api/#post_matrixclientv3usersuseridreport), to complement last release's report room endpoint - everything else is primarily maintenance of the spec. The full changelog is below, as always.
