### Extera

[OfficialDakari](https://matrix.to/#/@officialdakari:extera.xyz) says

> There weren't any updates for a long time, but today Extera is in TWIM, because I've got enough (3) changes to describe!
> 
> 1. There always was memory leak which caused Extera to use 100% CPU. It was fixed in latest commit, and it was there whole time! Now you won't be billed 1000$/mo for electricity if you use Extera.
> 2. Now settings category list and settings list don't scroll like one window. Minor change tho.
> 3. And, because of libolm deprecation (which happened a long time ago), Extera finally manages to start using Rust crypto.
> 4. Fixed ghost mode bug: Now, marking as read while you use ghost mode will use private read receipts.

> 
> We're just doing our best to keep this alive and not break in the changing landscape of Python libraries and new/experimental Matrix features

### Element X iOS ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios))

A total rewrite of Element-iOS using the Matrix Rust SDK underneath and targeting devices running iOS 16+.

[Mauro Romito](https://matrix.to/#/@mauro.romito:element.io) reports

> * A new release candidate has been made
> * This RC will also have enabled by default the event cache, to make the app even faster
> * We also added pills rendering to the composer, and is now possible to mention a room by using the "#" character, it will work just as EW, where you can filter based on the follow up text, and select the room you want to mention (which creates a permalink to it) by tapping on it
> * We added a badge in the composer for unencrypted rooms
> * We updated and improved our UI tests and our CI systems

## Dept of Widgets 🧩

### NeoBoard ([website](https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-neoboard))

Private and secure whiteboard for everyone

[Milton Moura (n.io)](https://matrix.to/#/@milton.moura:nordeck.io) announces

> **NeoBoard Widget v2.1.0**
> 
> The [NeoBoard Widget](https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-neoboard) just keeps chugging along with awesomeness! We just released [v2.1.0](https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-neoboard/releases/tag/%40nordeck%2Fmatrix-neoboard-widget%402.1.0) this week, which adds some new features and several improvements!
> 
> #### More fonts available for text shapes
> 
> Previously, we only supported text shapes with the `Inter` font. You now have a selection of 6 additonal fonts that you can use to express yourself with: `Abel`, `Actor`, `Adamina`, `Chewy`, `Gwendolyn` and `Pirata One`. Mix style with creativity and make your boards truly stand out! 🎨✨
> 
> #### Connecting shapes with lines and arrows
> 
> We’ve taken our arrow and line tools to the next level! Before, you couldn’t attach them to shapes, but now, lines and arrows seamlessly connect shapes—and stay connected even as you move them around.
> 
> This update is a game-changer, especially for creating diagrams and visually mapping out information flows with ease and precision. 🚀
> 
> #### Pasting images from the clipboard and new hotkey
> 
> Pasting images from the clipboard is now possible! No more downloading and uploading, just copy pasting! Also, use CTRL+D / CMD+D to duplicate a shape or selection of shapes for faster content creation!
> 
> ...And a lot more!
> 
> Check out the [changelog](https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-neoboard/releases/tag/%40nordeck%2Fmatrix-neoboard-widget%402.1.0) for a full list of other improvements and bug fixes.

## Dept of Bots 🤖

### Draupnir ([website](https://github.com/the-draupnir-project/Draupnir))

A moderation bot for open Matrix communities

[Gnuxie 💜🐝](https://matrix.to/#/@gnu_ponut:matrix.org) reports

> This week we released [Draupnir v2.2.0](https://github.com/the-draupnir-project/Draupnir/releases/tag/v2.2.0) which includes a rework of the `unban` command.  The unban command now shows a preview of all the policies that will be removed in order to unban a user, and any rooms that they will be unbanned from. The preview prompt can be skipped by using the `--no-confirm` option. Please note that the unban command no longer accepts an argument for a policy list.
> 
> We've also made some progress in this release towards _simulated protection capabilities_ which will allow us to include previews in more commands in the next releases (both `watch` and `ban`).
> 
> These improvments were added alongside a few other fixes in the follow up from the release of Draupnir 2.0. So checkout the [release notes](https://github.com/the-draupnir-project/Draupnir/releases/tag/v2.2.0) for the full picture. As always, we'll see you in [#draupnir:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#draupnir:matrix.org)

## Dept of Interesting Projects 🛰️

[networkException](https://matrix.to/#/@networkexception:nwex.de) says

> A while ago I wrote a little tool using the matrix-rust-sdk to manually download and decrypt media: https://git.nwex.de/networkException/matrix-media-event-decrypt
> 
> It supports a few options that can be helpful when debugging (like fetching from a different server) as well as the ability to download and decrypt all media from a JSON room export created by Element Web
