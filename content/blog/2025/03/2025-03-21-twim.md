## Dept of *Status of Matrix* 🌡️

### Trust and Safety Research and Documentation Working Group

[Nico](https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev) announces

> As part of my work for the Trust and Safety Committee I am trying to establish a working group to help with researching and documenting the state of T&S across the ecosystem. If that sounds interesting to you, please poke your head into [#governing-board-office:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#governing-board-office:matrix.org) and tell us!
> 
> To summarize what the group is about, the current proposal looks like this:
> 
> To make appropriate decisions, the T&S committee needs to know about the state of T&S in the wider ecosystem. It needs to have insights into current challenges, solutions and initiatives.
> On the other hand the community can also benefit from having some of that information documented.
> The T&S R&D WG is a tool to help with that. It includes a wider set of individuals and reports their research results to the T&S committee. In some cases the WG is also encouraged to enhance the documentation on matrix.org to help communities and users on Matrix moderate their rooms.
> The T&S committee might sometimes ask the WG for help in researching specific topics in more detail to guide their decisions.
> 
> Pledge of Confidentiality
> -------------------------
> 
> The WG will sometimes have to deal or come in contact with confidential data, possibly
> because of legal reasons, possibly because of active abuse concerns. While the
> WG is encouraged to be open, there
> will be times where the WG should keep certain information
> confidential and only share it with specific individuals. As the WG we pledge
> to keep information confidential when necessary while still being transparent
> and open where possible.
> The T&S committee may decide to remove members from the WG if it sees a member abusing their access to information or not acting in a trustworthy manner by sharing information the group agreed to keep confidential. This should be a last resort, needs a majority in the T&S committee and should be preceded by appropriate communication and warnings.
> 
> Typical Tasks
> -------------
> 
> * Gather information about current moderation challenges on Matrix and keep structured notes about them
> * Maintain an overview of available moderation tools and their capabilities
> * Create and maintain moderation guides on matrix.org in collaboration with the Website or Documentation WGs
> * Reach out to moderators to gather feedback or offer advice
> * Reports insights and opinions to the T&S committee and possibly other T&S working groups
> * Potentially collaborate on proposals with the T&S committee or other WGs
> * Turn some of their research into MSCs and collaboratively push them to completion as well as advise on other MSCs from a T&S perspective

View the [release checklist here](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/issues/2110) if you want to follow along in the meantime. There will be a blog post at the time to detail everything shiny and new!
> 
> Otherwise the Spec Core Team are still focusing on concluding Matrix 2.0-related MSCs. On the docket recently have been those for next-gen auth in Matrix. If you're interested in taking a look, [MSC3861](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/issues/3861) is the one to start with.

## Dept of Clients 📱

### Element X Android ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-android))

Android Matrix messenger application using the Matrix Rust SDK and Jetpack Compose.

[Benoit](https://matrix.to/#/@benoit.marty:matrix.org) says

### Element Call ([website](https://call.element.io))

Native Decentralised End-to-end Encrypted Group Calls in Matrix, as a standalone web app

[Florian Heese](https://matrix.to/#/@fheese:element.io) announces

> Hey Matrix fans! This week, we're rolling out **a major architectural change** in Element Call, alongside several UX improvements and new reactions. But first, an important announcement for self-hosters!
> 
> ## ⚠️ Reminder: Removal of Fallback MatrixRTC Backend soon™*
> 
> Currently, the default **Element Call widget** at [call.element.io](https://call.element.io/) provides a **fallback MatrixRTC backend** (sponsored by Element) for deployments without their own MatrixRTC setup.
> 
> With the move to **In-App bundling**, we plan to **remove this fallback soon** to encourage proper Matrix site setups. If you rely on this fallback, **now's the time to prepare! **Follow the [self-hosting guide](https://github.com/element-hq/element-call/blob/livekit/docs/self-hosting.md) to ensure your deployment supports** MatrixRTC/Element Call** properly.
> 
> (*) soon™ is around early next week
> 
> ## 🚀 Element Call [v0.8.0](https://github.com/element-hq/element-call/releases/tag/v0.8.0) released
> 
> This release brings a fundamental shift: **call participation and video tiles now rely on MatrixRTC membership** instead of the LiveKit room state. This marks the **final step toward enabling to-device media key exchange** for end-to-end encryption (E2EE).
> 
> To support this change, we introduced a new **MembershipManager**, making MatrixRTC membership the single source of truth to ensure correctness across all scenarios.
> 
> ### 🔥 Key Changes & Improvements
> 
> * **Video tiles** now track **MatrixRTC membership**, not LiveKit participants (essential for upcoming E2EE media key distribution improvements).
> * **Smoother call UX** -- video tiles are now **a lot more stable** when determining which ones should be on screen.
> * **New Sound Effects!** 🎵
>   * When you leave a call
>   * When screen sharing starts
> * **New Wave/Hello Reaction** 👋 
> * **Adaptive Themes** -- Element Call's widget mode now responds to theme changes.
> * **Improved Mute Behavior**:
>   * New cameras or microphones **won't start unmuted** when you plug them in during a call.
>   * Your **previous mute state is remembered** when you unplug a device and plug it back in.
> * **Better Error Handling** (first batch of improvements!):
>   * Detect **MatrixRTC backend capacity limits**.
>   * Handle cases where a **Matrix deployment doesn't advertise a MatrixRTC backend**.
> * **Enhancements in Widget Mode**:
>   * **Header is now hidden** for a cleaner look.
>   * Leave session & show **proper error screens** when failures occur.
>   * Introduced a **"close" action** when the widget is ready to shut down (helpful for error handling & other widgets).
> * **Visual feedback when your camera starts** in the Lobby.
> * **Authenticated media requests** when loading avatars.
> 
> With these updates, we're laying the foundation for a **to-device based E2EE media distribution** in Element Call while making everything more stable and polished! 🎉
> 
> ## Upcoming in Element Call v0.9.0
> 
> We've been working behind the scenes on testing and release processes to ensure that we can release more frequently. And so, Element Call v0.9.0 is already around the corner! It provides better feedback in a couple more error cases, and also contains the changes needed for proper In-App bundling.
> 
> 
> That's it for this week! **If you rely on the fallback MatrixRTC backend, please make sure you're ready before we remove it**. Got feedback or want to chat? Drop by [\#webrtc:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#webrtc:matrix.org)!
> 
> See you in the next call! 🚀

### Rory&::LibMatrix ([website](https://cgit.rory.gay/matrix/LibMatrix.git/))

.NET 8 matrix bot/client library/SDK

[Emma [it/its]](https://matrix.to/#/@emma:rory.gay) announces

> Lots and lots of work, such as things from ModerationClient, has been merged this time around, may today be a wild ride!
> 
> New features:
>   - Sync responses can now be stored on disk, allowing clients to resume quickly.
>     - Warning: it's very not efficient
>   - "Sync state resolution"/checkpoint support, to make clients resume even faster!
>   - Synapse admin API support (incomplete, but quite a bit of coverage), allowing server admins to administer their server from simple bots or tools.
>   - Ominous commit named "[meow](https://cgit.rory.gay/matrix/LibMatrix.git/commit/LibMatrix?id=db0e87c0d610dbb24c3b62b37f2639245e9c3d3b)", adding partial support for MSC4133 - Custom profile fields (is it even up to date?)
>   - Extended invite listener API in bot utilities, allowing bot developers or end users to get greater control over exactly what happens as far as the sync loop is concerned.
>   - Added a specialised room wrapper for dealing with policy lists, allowing tooling to become much simpler.
>   - Allow developers to opt out of request logging, reducing the signal to noise ratio in logs.
> 
> _**And, as always:**_
> 
> * The code is available at [cgit.rory.gay](https://cgit.rory.gay/matrix/LibMatrix.git) (or [Github - read only, may be outdated](https://github.com/Rory-LibMatrix/LibMatrix.git))!
>     - All contributions are more than welcome, be it documentation, code, anything! Perhaps, example usecases, bots, ...?
> * Discussion, suggestions and ideas are welcome in [#libmatrix:rory.gay](https://matrix.to/#/#libmatrix:rory.gay) (Space: [#mru-space:rory.gay](https://matrix.to/#/#mru-space:rory.gay))
> * Got a cool project that you're working on and want to share, using LibMatrix? Be sure to let us know, we'd love to hear all about it!

## Dept of Bots 🤖

### Rory&::Matrix-Anti-DM-Spam (Simple Matrix bot to automatically reject spam invites)

[Emma [it/its]](https://matrix.to/#/@emma:rory.gay) says

> Hi all! It's been a while since I last gave a sign of life.
> Today I present to you: somewhat of a solution to invite spam!
> 
> The basic concept is that the bot rejects invites based on policy lists, as used by Mjolnir and Draupnir. This is a user bot, *not* a tool for server admins! (Soon, though :))
> "But how would users reach out to appeal?", you might ask. That's been thought of! Every rejected invite is logged into a room for you!
> 
> Interested? Check out [the repository](https://cgit.rory.gay/matrix/tools/MatrixAntiDmSpam.git/about/)!
> 
> _**And, as always:**_
