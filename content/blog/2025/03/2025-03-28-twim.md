## Dept of Spec 📜

[Andrew Morgan (anoa) {he/him}](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io) announces

> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <https://spec.matrix.org/proposals>.
> 
> 
> ### MSC Status
> 
> **New MSCs:**
> * [MSC4279: Server notice rooms](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4279)
> * [MSC4278: Media preview controls](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4278)
> 
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
> * [MSC4254: Usage of RFC7009 Token Revocation for Matrix client logout](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4254) (merge)
> * [MSC2965: OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata discovery](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2965) (merge)

> 
> Matrix v1.14 was released today! Read more about it on [the blog post](https://matrix.org/blog/2025/03/27/matrix-v1.14-release/).
> 
> Otherwise work has been steadily progressing on next-generation auth MSCs. There's now only three remaining ([MSC2964](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2964), [MSC2967](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2967/), [MSC2966](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2966/)) that need ticks. They're likely to land very soon, so watch this space!
> 
> Finally, [MSC2545: Image Packs (Emoticons & Stickers)](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2545/) (aka custom emoji) received some much-needed love yesterday. Thanks to Skye for poking me with a large stick to resolve the majority of the remaining open threads. The MSC is now close to being proposed for FCP merge!

> 
> * We published Element X Android [v25.03.2](https://github.com/element-hq/element-x-android/releases/tag/v25.03.2) in the stores and uploaded [v25.03.3](https://github.com/element-hq/element-x-android/releases/tag/v25.03.3) and [v25.03.4](https://github.com/element-hq/element-x-android/releases/tag/v25.03.4) to both Github releases and the Google Play Store open testing lane.
> * We improved user mention and room pills both in the composer and the timeline items.
> * Integrated a bundled version of Element Call into the app so you don't need to use an external service for in-app calls inside Matrix rooms.
> * Added some checks to avoid malicious redirections of links where the displayed text would point to a URL and the actual URL would take you to some different one.
> * We're working on improving UX and aligning some Android and iOS detail implementations (video autoplay, timeline item sender info touch areas and feedback, etc.).
> * And of course, the mandatory 'bugfixes and improvements' changelog entry.

### Element ([website](https://element.io))

Everything related to Element but not strictly bound to a client

[Will L](https://matrix.to/#/@willl:element.io) announces

> Element has had a constant stream of requests for official Helm charts for Synapse and, with Matrix 2.0 materialising, there's even more interest in Helm charts to coordinate the various moving parts. 
> 
> Today we're very excited to provide an initial release of [Element Server Suite, Community Edition](http://github.com/element-hq/ess-helm) (ESS Community), providing long-awaited open source Helm charts from Element, built as an official non-commercial open source Matrix distribution for the wider Matrix community. The initial release orchestrates Synapse, Matrix Authentication Service (MAS), Element Web and supporting infrastructure; Element Call will be coming soon (for now, it’s configured to use a MatrixRTC backend provided by Element). ESS Community is designed to easily and quickly set up a Matrix deployment, even if you don’t have any Kubernetes knowledge. Give it a shot and let us know what you think in the [ESS Community Matrix room](https://matrix.to/#/#ess-community:element.io). 
> 
> As the name implies, ESS Community is tailored to small-/mid-scale, community use cases. Those that want to use Matrix in a formal workplace - requiring the likes of SBOMs, Support, LTS, Advance Security Advisory, scalability, multi-tenancy and enterprise features or need compliance with regulations such as EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) or Gematik TI-M - should use [ESS Pro](https://element.io/server-suite).

### dendritecli v1.2.0

[nex (she/it)🦈🐈️](https://matrix.to/#/@nex:nexy7574.co.uk) reports

> dendritecli v1.2.0 has been released!
> 
> v1.2.0 patches some bugs related to outdated HTTP libraries, and some timeouts on API requests that took too long (namely room purging).
> However, since I've never posted about this project before, here's an overview of what dendritecli is:
> 
> > dendritecli is a friendly command line tool designed for making standard Dendrite administration tasks (such as creating/deactivating users, evacuating rooms and users, purging rooms, and resetting passwords) simple and easy to remember. Once you've set an account token, and optionally pointed the command in the direction of your database, you won't need to remember those curl commands again.
> 
> This release is now on PyPi! You can install it with `pipx install dendritecli` (or `pip install dendritecli` if you don't have pipx)
> 
> Contact: [#ontopic:nexy7574.co.uk](https://matrix.to/#/#ontopic:nexy7574.co.uk) | GitHub: <https://github.com/nexy7574/dendritecli> | PyPi: <https://pypi.org/p/dendritecli/>

### synadm ([website](https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm))

Command line admin tool for Synapse (Matrix homeserver)

[jacksonchen666 (they/it)](https://matrix.to/#/@jacksonchen666:jacksonchen666.com) announces

> synadm is (almost finished) migrating to Codeberg!
> 
> Our Codeberg repository is at <https://codeberg.org/synadm/synadm>. We migrated from GitHub (from <https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm>) and also moved things into an organization, so now the bus factor should be 2 (me and JOJ0) for the entire project, including code, PyPI, and docs. The current progress of things and checklist can be viewed at <https://codeberg.org/synadm/synadm/issues/174>.
> 
> This shouldn't mean much if you installed synadm via PyPI (with pip or pipx), but it does mean you'll have to change git remote URLs if you've cloned synadm (for development or run code from the master branch), or if you're a linux distro package maintainer using tarballs from GitHub.
> 
> If you have any questions, comments, or issues you wish to report, please head to [#synadm:peek-a-boo.at](https://matrix.to/#/%23synadm:peek-a-boo.at) for now.

### Draupnir ([website](https://github.com/the-draupnir-project/Draupnir))

A moderation bot for open Matrix communities

[Gnuxie 💜🐝](https://matrix.to/#/@gnu_ponut:matrix.org) says

> Draupnir is looking for feedback on [new homeserver administrative](https://the-draupnir-project.github.io/draupnir-documentation/bot/homeserver-administration) features for server admins (particularly those with open registration) in the newly released [Draupnir v2.3.0-beta.0](https://github.com/the-draupnir-project/Draupnir/releases/tag/v2.3.0-beta.0). 
> 
> This release brings policy list support for blocking and purging rooms on your homeserver via a new [_Room Takedown Protection_](https://the-draupnir-project.github.io/draupnir-documentation/protections/room-takedown-protection). Which includes support for [MSC4204: Takedown moderation policy recommendation](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4204) & [MSC4205: Hashed moderation policy entities](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4205). We also provide a configurable utility as part of the protection to discover the details of the rooms your homeserver is participaiting in.
> 
> We are also providing a new way to block invitations to users on your homeserver via the new [_Block invitations on server protection_](https://the-draupnir-project.github.io/draupnir-documentation/protections/block-invitations-on-server-protection). This is compatible with synapse workers and replaces the functionality from the legacy synapse module. This work is thanks to tulir's [synapse-http-antispam](https://github.com/maunium/synapse-http-antispam) module.
> 
> There are a few other changes in this release, so you should check the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/the-draupnir-project/Draupnir/blob/v2.3.0-beta.0/CHANGELOG.md#v230-beta0). See you in [#draupnir:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#draupnir:matrix.org).
