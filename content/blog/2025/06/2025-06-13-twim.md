## Dept of Spec 📜

[Andrew Morgan (anoa) {he/him}](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io) reports

> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <https://spec.matrix.org/proposals>.
> 
> 
> ### MSC Status
> 
> **New MSCs:**
> * [[WIP] MSC4299: trusted users](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4299)
> * [[WIP] MSC4298: Room version components for 'Redact on ban'](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4298)
> 
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
> * *No MSCs are in FCP.*
> 
> **Accepted MSCs:**
> * *No MSCs were accepted this week.*
> 
> **Closed MSCs:**
> * [MSC4248: Pull-based presence](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4248)
>     * Closed in favour of [MSC4259](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4259) and [MSC4208](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4208).
>     
> See the list of MSCs with proposed final comment period [here](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pulls?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc%20is%3Apr%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Aproposed-final-comment-period)!
> 
> ### Spec Updates
> 
> Implementations of several Trust & Safety MSCs, such as [MSC4155: Invite Filtering](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4155) and [MSC4293: Redact on Kick/Ban](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4293) have been landing over the past week, which is encouraging to see. MSCs cannot be accepted without at least one implementation, so writing code is an essential step is moving those spam-combating features into the spec.
> 
> In the same vein, new MSCs around Trust & Safety are continuing to be introduced. If combating spam and abuse on the network interests you, now is an excellent time to get involved in the spec!

## Dept of Bridges 🌉

### matrix-hookshot ([website](https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-hookshot))

A multi purpose multi platform bridge, connecting to GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Webhooks and more.

[Half-Shot](https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk) reports

> Hi folks. Typically I like to do an announcement on release, but we've been doing quite a few things behind the scenes and I wanted to keep the momentum up so a smaller update from me this week. The headlines are:
> 
> #### Better developer experience! (Finally)
> 
> We're happy to announce we've shipped a [new guide](https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-hookshot/latest/dev/setup.html) on how to be a developer on Hookshot. This covers how to get started with an environment to hack on the project, including a batteries-included docker compose for the absolute Matrix novice :). I expect this area will eventually be filled out with more architectural information on how it works under the hood, but for now this is a start :).
> 
> If you've got feedback on this, or want any help along the way then we are happy to help out in [#hookshot:half-shot.uk](https://matrix.to/#/#hookshot:half-shot.uk) :)
> 
> #### We now ping the homeserver on startup
> 
> which is great as it now means issues with your configuration will be flagged much sooner. Hookshot will do a full round trip ping to discover if your homeserver can reach the bridge too. [Synapse v1.132.0](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/releases/tag/v1.132.0rc1) will also support immediate recovery on pings so no longer will you need to wait for backoff when restarting a bridge.
> 
> #### Encryption stability is making baby steps
> 
> I know this has been a very hot topic for a lot of folks for a while, and we're doing our best to make encrypted hookshot better! A small improvement this week is that Hookshot now emits it's device identity on startup, so manual verification of the bridge is now possible. With <https://github.com/element-hq/element-web/pull/30094>, this should make the process a bit smoother.
> 
> On a final note, we're still hard at work building out the new interactive commands / element timeline rendering features for Hookshot, which is taking a bit more time due to the number of PRs that need to land (at the last count, 5 are involved in the full feature set). This is happening now though, and I hope that next week we will be bringing you a release that covers it all. Until next time!

## Dept of Clients 📱

### Extera Next

[OfficialDakari](https://matrix.to/#/@officialdakari:extera.xyz) reports

> Hello! During this week, a few changes happened in Extera Next:
> * Migration to Vodozemac. Extera Next now uses Vodozemac too, as FluffyChat (i totally didn't steal any code)
> * Fixed plaintext password dialog when deactivating account or removing a device
> * Fixed terrible design of lock screen. Removed app banner and changed input placeholder to "PIN code" instead of 4 asterisks 
> * Removed send image/video buttons. Send file can do the same, why to have them?
> 
> Download APK: <https://extera.xyz/next/next.apk?_cacheBuster>
> 
> Git: <https://git.extera.xyz/OfficialDakari/ExteraNext>
> 
> Quick note: Extera stumbled upon censorship in Russia. If you live there, use VPN/proxy to access it. I am planning on adding Singbox client into Extera Next.

### Element X iOS ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios))

A total rewrite of Element iOS using the Matrix Rust SDK underneath and targeting devices running iOS 16+.

[Mauro Romito](https://matrix.to/#/@mauro.romito:element.io) says

> * we released a new version with an important security update, for more information check [here](https://github.com/element-hq/element-x-ios/releases/tag/release%2F25.06.3)
> * Threads are now available as an experimental developer option! They are still WIP and may lead to unexpected behaviour, but if you want you can try them out.
> * some accessibility improvements were made across the app and many more are to come!
> * Fixed a bug that was crashing the app on the new iOS 26 beta versions

## Dept of Non Chat Clients 🎛️

[andybalaam](https://matrix.to/#/@andybalaam:matrix.org) says

> Announcing `mx`: an experimental command line tool for messing with your Matrix account.
> 
> This is a tool that is intended to run as part of scripts and automation, as opposed to being interactive. It's written in Rust.
> 
> Example:
> 
> ```
> $ mx login https://chat.example.com myusername
> ...
> $ mx recovery status
> ...
>     master_key=rPnI6NjlQcJRuEEaTwpAOv41k/dkh8ckgdTIJXNE+xU
>     user_signing_key=jsdfFsdsd04fks93r/3r2fufwojiwef9FEJfeijdeDD
>     self_signing_key=iFeZWnl/XscWzztml2xh8RlkqaLKa78ekK4ncJFnSy8
> ```
> 
> It's mostly good for encryption-adjacent things for now, but I vaguely plan to allow it to send messages and similar things in future.

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰

### matrix-rust-sdk ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk))

Your all-in-one toolkit for creating Matrix clients with Rust, from simple bots to full-featured apps, with bindings to Swift, Kotlin, WebAssembly, Go and more

[Ivan 🦀](https://matrix.to/#/@mnt_io:matrix.org) reports

> Hi there. Shorter TWIM this week, but big progresses!
> 
> #### Release
> 
> The Matrix Rust SDK 0.12 has been released! Please see the [release notes](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/releases/tag/matrix-sdk-0.12.0). This release contains a security fix, consider to update your project as quick as possible!
> 
> #### Thread
> 
> First threads support has landed in two clients: Multiverse (our development-, debug-oriented CLI Matrix client), and Element X nightly (note that the UI is **not** the final design, it's a test-oriented feature for the moment). Amongst many things, the followings are notable:
> 
> * [#5227](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5227) When a user is writing a message, it is a “draft”, which can be saved by the SDK, allowing the user to do something else and getting back to it later. Well, this also works within a thread now!
> * [#5210](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5210) Multiverse supports threads!
> * [#5198](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5198) When a client doesn't support threads, threads are rendered as replies: each message is marked as a reply of the previous message in the same thread. What if your client supports threads and one thread contains a real reply to a message? Well, it wasn't working well. Now it works well.
> * [#5185](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5185) The `Timeline` gains superpowers to filtering out messages that are part of a thread, so they can be rendered separately.
> 
> Threads are making great progresses, but events are not persisted in a storage so far. Happily, progress on that front has been made too!
> 
> * [#5172](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5172) and [#5182](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5182) prepares the event cache for storing a linked chunk per thread.
> 
> #### WebAssembly
> 
> Work on WebAssembly pursues. This time, the first set of patches to make the `EventCacheStore` compatible with [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) has been merged.
> 
> * [#5138](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5138) The initial types and the database migrations for `EventCacheStore` on IndexedDb has landed. It's the foundation for the next patches to make the whole `EventCacheStore` compatible with IndexedDB when compiled to `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
> 
> #### Crypto
> 
> * [#5219](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5219) If the SDK believes that the sender of a room event has been spoofed, the SDK will use a dedicated verification level, possibly allowing us to treat such events more carefully. This new verification level is `MismatchedSender`.
> 
> #### General
> 
> * [#5205](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5205) We are reverting our experiment around `busy_timeout` with SQLite to compare the data and see if it's helping fixing some lock issues.
> * [#5099](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5099) When using `Client::add_event_handler`, it is now possible to define a callback with an argument of kind `Option<EncryptionInfo>`, which is particularly useful and requested by the community frequently!

### Matrix Dart SDK ([website](https://github.com/famedly/matrix-dart-sdk))

Matrix SDK written in pure Dart.

[td](https://matrix.to/#/@td:technodisaster.com) reports

> #### Released v1.0.0 this week

> * v1.14 spec endpoints support
> * A bunch of other breaking changes since the last announcement, <https://github.com/famedly/matrix-dart-sdk/releases>
> 
> That's it for now. Until next time! bye byee 👋
