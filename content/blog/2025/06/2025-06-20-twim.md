## Dept of elections 🗳️



### Governing Board ([website](https://matrix.org/foundation/governing-board/))

The Governing Board is an advisory board to the Matrix.org Foundation and with elected representatives from all across the Matrix ecosystem.

[Robin Riley (m.org)](https://matrix.to/#/@robinriley:matrix.org) says

> ### Governing Board election results
>

## Dept of Spec 📜

[Andrew Morgan (anoa) {he/him}](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io) announces

> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <https://spec.matrix.org/proposals>.
> 
> 
> ### MSC Status
> 
> **New MSCs:**
> * [MSC4301: Event capability negotiation between clients](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4301)
> * [MSC4300: Processing status requests & responses](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4300)
> 
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
> * *No MSCs are in FCP.*
> 
> **Accepted MSCs:**
> * *No MSCs were accepted this week.*
> 
> **Closed MSCs:**
> * [MSC4113: Image hashes in Policy Lists](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4113)
> * [MSC4015: Voluntary Bot indicators](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4015)
> * [MSC3006: Bot Interactions](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3006)
>

> 
> ### Spec Updates
> 
> Matrix 2.0 is still coming together. A huge part of it is Next-Generation Authentication (aka. OAuth 2.0/OIDC). While the relevant MSCs have been accepted for a little while now, writing up the actual changes to the spec have yet to happen.
> 
> That is, until, [Kévin Commaille](https://github.com/zecakeh) took it upon themselves to do so! Ever the avid contributor of the Matrix spec, Kévin has [created a number of PRs](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc%20is%3Apr%20state%3Aclosed%20author%3Azecakeh) that translates the five separate next-gen auth MSCs into actual updates to the spec. This is a daunting task, and we commend Kévin for taking it on and keeping on top of it!

## Dept of Servers 🏢



### Matrix Authentication Service ([website](https://github.com/element-hq/matrix-authentication-service))

Matrix Authentication Service (MAS) is an OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Provider server developed by Element.

[Quentin Gliech](https://matrix.to/#/@quenting:element.io) reports

> ### Matrix Authentication Service
> 
> This week, we've released MAS 0.17, which, along with a few additions to its admin API and some small bug fixes, brings [registration tokens to MAS](https://github.com/element-hq/matrix-authentication-service/pull/4619) as a way for you to onboard new users onto your homeserver in a controlled manner.
> 
> See the [full release notes for 0.17.0 here](https://github.com/element-hq/matrix-authentication-service/releases/tag/v0.17.0) and for [0.17.1](https://github.com/element-hq/matrix-authentication-service/releases/tag/v0.17.1), which was released shortly afterward to fix a minor regression.
> 
> With the next generation auth APIs [landing in the spec recently](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+OAuth+2.0+author%3Azecakeh), we're now working on support for the stable spec, getting MAS to 1.0, as well as making the MAS integration in Synapse non-experimental.

## Dept of Clients 📱



### Fractal ([website](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/fractal))

[Jorge](https://matrix.to/#/@jorgem:element.io) announces

> # Element X Android
> 
> This week we've released an RC version for [v25.06.3](https://github.com/element-hq/element-x-android/releases/tag/v25.06.3), which is still marked as pre-release. We plan to add new release candidate versions as pre-releases in Github and then upgrade them to full releases once they're available in the stores after some testing - which we're deeply grateful for 🙏.
> 
> Other than that, we've made some good progress on:
> 
> * Supporting room upgrades.
> * Improving accessibility in several parts of the app.
> * Adding experimental support for room history sharing.
> * Improving the reliability of push notifications.

## Dept of Widgets 🧩



### Matrix Widget Toolkit ([website](https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-widget-toolkit))

Reusable framework for creating Matrix widgets.

[Milton Moura (n.io)](https://matrix.to/#/@milton.moura:nordeck.io) says

> ### Matrix Widget Toolkit
> 
> #### New releases with support for sending delayed events
> 
> We at [Nordeck](https://nordeck.net/) have been busy bringing MatrixRTC with LiveKit Backend to the [NeoBoard Widget](https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-neoboard), and part of that endeavour is using delayed events, as proposed in [MSC4140](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4140), to clean up the realtime session membership state when you become inactive or leave a realtime collaborative whiteboarding session.
> 
> So, last week, we have updated the [Matrix Widget Toolkit](https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-widget-toolkit), the foundation for our widget applications, to support sending delayed room state and room timeline events, as well as updating them, so you can restart the delay, and let them linger for bit longer, or just cancel them before they are effectively merged into the room DAG.
> 
> To show delayed events in usage, we updated the [Throw Dice](https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-widget-toolkit/blob/main/example-widget-mui/src/DicePage/DicePage.tsx) example widget to include the option to send a custom event with a few seconds delay. To test this, be aware that you should [enable delayed events](https://element-hq.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/configuration/config_documentation.html#max_event_delay_duration) support in your Synapse homeserver configuration.
> 
> This means we have new minor version releases of the [matrix-widget-toolkit/api](https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-widget-toolkit/releases/tag/%40matrix-widget-toolkit%2Fapi%404.2.0) (v4.2.0) and [matrix-widget-toolkit/testing](https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-widget-toolkit/releases/tag/%40matrix-widget-toolkit%2Ftesting%403.1.0) (v3.1.0) packages with delayed events support, and new patch releases of the [matrix-widget-toolkit/react](https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-widget-toolkit/releases/tag/%40matrix-widget-toolkit%2Freact%402.0.6) (v2.0.6) and [matrix-widget-tookkit/mui](https://github.com/nordeck/matrix-widget-toolkit/releases/tag/%40matrix-widget-toolkit%2Fmui%402.1.3) (v2.1.3) that also bring updates to vite and react related dependencies.

## Dept of Bots 🤖

[wreck [m.org backup account, do not ping]](https://matrix.to/#/@wreck:matrix.org) reports

> minor usability improvements to the communitybot plugin for maubot have been added! [repo](https://github.com/williamkray/maubot-communitybot)
> 
> what is this? communitybot is a plugin for maubot that aims to make managing your community rooms on matrix as friendly and simple as on other platforms. it provides capabilities for you to easily create and add new rooms, replace or archive old ones, manage permissions of your community moderators, and track user activity for pruning inactive users! it also supports basic spam mitigation mechanisms such as message redaction based on word lists or file upload, subscribing to public banlists such as CME, and a human-verification-before posting based on power-level.
> 
> new in the latest version is an `initialize` command to get you up and running a community based on opinionated defaults. if you're using the unedited base config, the command will:
> 
> 1. create a new space and update your plugin config to use it
> 2. automatically add you to the list of users to invite to all new rooms, and set your power to administrator
> 3. create a private, dedicated room for moderators to use for bot commands away from the rest of the community
> 4. create a public "waiting room" where matrix users from anywhere can join and ask to be invited to your space
> 5. enable initial wordlist- and file-based message redaction in your waiting room (update your wordlist as appropriate instead of the current `effword` and `essword` placeholders)
> 6. ensure that all future rooms require moderator permissions to invite additional users, to prevent unexpected "guests" in your community
> 
> using the bot for all room and space creation will ensure that the bot always has higher permission than even administrators to avoid permission issues on other bot commands in the future.
> 
> check out the [README](https://github.com/williamkray/maubot-communitybot/blob/main/README.md) for more information, come ask questions in [#dev:mssj.me](https://matrix.to/#/#dev:mssj.me) , and happy community-building!
> 
> _nota bene: this bot is intended for creating and managing "gated" communities, akin to a slack workspace or discord server. this helps to reduce moderation overhead. fighting spam across multiple public rooms is no fun, but if you want to try to do that you will continue to be better suited with a tool like Draupnir/Meowlnir/Mjolnir. if you really like AI for some reason, you may be interested in my separate [LLM-powered moderation bot](https://github.com/williamkray/maubot-aimoderator)_

## Dept of Events and Talks 🗣️

> 
> It is summer in Germany, and hackers are gathering in Karlsruhe for tinkering and eating goulash at [GPN23](https://gulas.ch). So are we!
> 
> The conference started on Thursday June 19th and continues until Sunday June 22nd. Yesterday, we hosted an [introductory workshop](https://cfp.gulas.ch/gpn23/talk/QFGZCN/) about how to choose a Matrix client, that was well attended. We have put the Matrix ~~curtain~~banner up among the hacker space and pride flags. If you are attending and interested in discussion Matrix, there is a good chance you can meet us in the vicinity! You can also always join our Matrix room [#community-events:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#community-events:matrix.org), and [#chaosevents:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#chaosevents:matrix.org) for events related to [CCC](https://ccc.de) specifically.
> 
> For more info about Matrix Community Events, visit <https://matrix-community.events>.
> 
> Don't forget our next self-organised event is coming up end of July:
> Matrix Community Summit is back in 2025, baby!
> Find out more in the [announcement TWIM post](https://matrix.org/blog/2025/05/30/this-week-in-matrix-2025-05-30/#matrix-community-summit-2025).

## Dept of Interesting Projects 🛰️

[spaetz](https://matrix.to/#/@spaetz:sspaeth.de) announces

> Two weeks ago, [testmatrix](https://codeberg.org/spaetz/testmatrix), a matrix server sanity checker was born and announced [here](https://matrix.org/blog/2025/06/05/this-week-in-matrix-2025-06-06/#new-matrix-server-sanity-checker). Since then, it has grown to version v0.0.8 and proven useful for supporting new users and their setups.
> It is available at [pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/testmatrix/), so you can easily install `testmatrix` via `pip` or `uvenv` (or simply check out the [code](https://codeberg.org/spaetz/testmatrix) and run without installation).
> 
> Notable additions since that initial announcement:
> 
> **Specific for MatrixRTC (aka Element Call):**
> 
> * Test for unstable support of MSC3266 (Room summaries)
> * Test whether delayed events (MSC 4140) are enabled when MatrixRTC configured
>   (Fun fact: Testing my tool, I discovered that matrix.org has them still turned off :-)).
> 
> **General improvements:**
> 
> * Test for guest access and/or presumable open registration being enabled
> * Add --anonymize switch (to censor domains from your logs for submission; still check the submitted content though!)
> * Added a CI action, that runs the source checker mypy automatically on all commits, which is a bit of a pain, but has found real bugs...
> 
> If you have problems or ideas, hop into [#testmatrix:sspaeth.de](://matrix.to/#/#testmatrix:sspaeth.de?via=sspaeth.de&via=matrix.org) and let me know.

## Matrix in the News 📰

[spaetz](https://matrix.to/#/@spaetz:sspaeth.de) announces

> An [article at heise.de](https://www.heise.de/news/Matrix-statt-MJP-ZBP-Co-Ist-bald-Schluss-mit-dem-staatlichen-Postfach-Chaos-10449410.html) (in German) reports that the German federal government and states will decide on June 26 whether to use Matrix as a common basis for their communication. Apparently, the plan was created by the states of Hamburg, Sachsen-Anhalt and the German digitalization agency "Fitko". According to the article, if decided upon, the plan is to conclude phase "transition planning and validation" until the 2nd quarter 2026, followed by phase "transition & migration", with regular operations starting in 2028.
