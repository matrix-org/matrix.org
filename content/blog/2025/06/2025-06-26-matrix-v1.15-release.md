Hey all,

[Matrix 1.15](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.15/) is here with improvements to authentication, room summaries, and rich topics! [A few months ago](/blog/2025/03/27/matrix-v1.14-release/) we were starting to see the next generation authentication MSCs (led by [MSC3861](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3861)) enter Final Comment Period and work towards acceptance. In that time, they've progressed all the way to being merged with today's release thanks to [KÃ©vin Commaille](https://github.com/zecakeh)'s [generous contributions](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc%20is%3Apr%20state%3Aclosed%20author%3Azecakeh).

This post covers some of the highlights from the 10 MSCs the release brings to the world, with the full changelog at the end as always.

## Next-generation Authentication

Over the last several years, there has been significant effort put into designing, implementing, and deploying industry-standard authentication for Matrix in the form of OIDC. Though the MSCs were [first opened in 2022](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3861), the work [hit the spotlight in 2023](/blog/2023/09/better-auth/) to outline how the system is expected to work, setting the stage for this year's [incredible migration](/blog/2025/04/morg-now-running-mas/) of 110 million matrix.org users in just 30 minutes.

With the MSCs [part of the spec](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.15/client-server-api/#client-authentication), we're now a full step closer to Matrix 2.0 being released. The remainder of Matrix 2.0 will take some time still to fully land in the spec, but there's progress being made in the meantime. MSC enthusiasts should also take a look at a [number of enhancement proposals](/blog/2025/04/morg-now-running-mas/#moving-forward) to the next-gen auth system which will be making their way towards the spec over the next while.

Congratulations to the team, and thanks for making Matrix a safer and more secure place.


## Room summaries

[MSC3266](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3266) has been around for a while in various forms (including a brief moment where it was used in production, oops ðŸ™ˆ), and has finally made it [to the spec](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.15/client-server-api/#room-summaries). Clients can use the new endpoint to get richer information about a room they're not quite participating in yet, providing a better experience to users on invites, knocks, and even [matrix.to](matrix.to) links. Most clients have already implemented support, but if yours could do with better context on unjoined rooms in particular, this could be the missing piece they need to make that happen.

Thanks to Nico for bearing with us through the years of review, and final push to the spec itself.


## Rich topics

Rooms can now be **bold **and use lists to the heart's content thanks to [MSC3765](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3765) landing in the spec. Some rooms already make use of this to provide user-friendly links to information in their topics, and now all rooms can use the stable identifiers to represent their rooms in the richest way possible. Under the hood, the feature makes use of [Extensible Events](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/blob/main/proposals/1767-extensible-events.md), but avoids the requirement for a new room version thanks to healthy fallback support - clients are encouraged to experiment with different rendering approaches ahead of extensible events (slowly) working its way towards a spec release.

Thanks to Johannes for landing this highly requested feature in the spec.
