It is an honor to unveil the election results and introduce the newest elected representatives of the Governing Board!

Congratulations to the winning candidates, we thank you for your willingness to serve the community. We're also grateful to everyone who threw their hat in the ring, and hope that the candidates who did not get elected consider running again in the future. Thanks also to the outgoing members of the Governing Board for their service in the precedent-setting first cohort!

I'd also like to express our gratitude to all the people who cast ballots in the election, and to everyone who asked questions along the way! We learn a lot in each election and we look forward to improving it each successive year.

Read on to see who is on the Governing Board and a brief discussion of next steps.

<!-- more -->

Our Governing Board has 8 constituencies that have elected representatives. Last year was our first election, and so we ran an election for all 8 constituencies. Starting this year and moving forward, we run elections in only half of the constituencies. This staggered approach to our elections allows us to strike a balance between experienced representatives and fresh perspectives, and the continuity it affords allows us to build up institutional capacity and knowledge over time.

This year we are seating representatives for the following constituencies: [Individual Members](https://opavote.com/results/5202655923666944), Associate Members, [Silver Members](https://opavote.com/results/5206099480805376), and Gold Members. Because we had fewer candidates than seats for Associate and Gold Members, we did not run elections in those categories.

These are the elected representatives for each of those constituencies:

Individual Members
- Andy Balaam (he/him)
- Gnuxie (she/her)
- Greg Sutcliffe (he/him)
- J.B. Crawford (they/them)

Associate Members
- Tobias Fella (he/him), KDE e.V.
- One vacant seat

Silver Members
- Christian Kußowski (he/him), Famedly
- Jan Kohnert (he/him), Gematik GmbH

Gold Members
- Brad Murray (he/him), Automattic (Beeper)
- Two vacant seats

Learn more about the Governing Board and see the full set of representatives on the [Governing Board information page](/foundation/governing-board/). You can find the entire slate of 2025 candidates on the [2025 election page](/foundation/governing-board-elections/2025/).

## Next steps

All of the elected representatives will soon receive a welcome email and details about onboarding which will take place over the next month. We'll hold a Governing Board meeting soon thereafter, in addition to the twice annual meetings that the Terms of Reference require us to convene.

Our next meeting will include updating committee assignments, filling any vacant Chair or Vice Chair positions, and other agenda items within the Governing Board's remit.

I'll be coordinating with our Governing Board Chair and Vice Chair in managing the onboarding and offboarding of Governing Board members to the private Matrix rooms, Discourse forums, and mailing list.

Onwards and upwards 🚀
