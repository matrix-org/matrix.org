> 
> Phew, quite a lot of new MSCs this week, covering some very interesting topics as well!
> 
> This week also saw the release of [Matrix v1.16](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.16), which brings [extensible profiles](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.16/client-server-api/#profiles) and [room version 12](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.16/rooms/v12/), alongside a host of other changes. See [the dedicated blog post](@/blog/2025/09/2025-09-17-matrix-v1.16-release.md) for more details and the full changelog.
> 
> As one can see, the team is really quite excited about it:
> 
> ![pcloke sending celebratory emoji reactions in response to the spec release announcement across a multitude of rooms.](/blog/img/2025-09-19-spec-1.16-party.avif)
> 
> Otherwise the SCT is currently focused on the proposals under the umbrella of [Matrix 2.0](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3Amatrix-2.0). Keep an eye out over the next few weeks as the SCT works to bring them towards a conclusion, hopefully in time for the [Matrix Conference](https://conference.matrix.org/) in October.

[Kegan](https://matrix.to/#/@kegan:matrix.org) says

> If you've ever wanted to let any user set temporary, per-user room state in a room, you may be interested in [MSC4354: Sticky Events](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4354) which enables this. From announcing that you're on a call to broadcasting your live location, there are many use cases for such per-user room state. What's more, this state can be encrypted just like normal messages because that's ultimately what sticky events are: normal messages with stronger delivery guarantees.
> 
> I'm currently working on getting an implementation working in Synapse, and would appreciate feedback on the proposal from the community.

## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Tuwunel

[jason 🎔](https://matrix.to/#/@jason:tuwunel.me) reports

> **Tuwunel is the enterprise successor to conduwuit** 🏳️‍⚧️ **funded in part by the Government of Switzerland** 🇨🇭
> 
> #### ✨ New Features For Version 1.4.2
> 
> * [Requested](https://github.com/matrix-construct/tuwunel/issues/158) by alaviss an alternative DNS resolver can be used to reach local appservices and configured for minimal caching.
> * Thanks to a [report](https://github.com/matrix-construct/tuwunel/issues/151) by DetermineAbsurd the `m.federate` field can be defaulted or forced to false when creating rooms using a new config option.
> * [Contributed](https://github.com/matrix-construct/tuwunel/pull/150) by tototomate123 a nifty experimental feature can disable push notifications when you're active on one device from being sent to any others. Please thank them when your pocket stops vibrating while chatting on your desktop!
> * By request of gr1n verbose logging builds are now bundled with this release. This mode contains additional messages at all levels optimized away in other release modes; this comes at some performance penalty.
> * JWT tokens can now be used for authentication on any endpoint which supports UIA. This feature was commissioned and made public by an enterprise sponsor.
> 
> #### 📈 Enhancements
> 
> * Sliding-sync has been significantly refactored: performance has massively increased with many bugs and compliance issues also fixed.
> * Hydra backports are now enabled by default; the change should be completely transparent.
> 
> Room deletions now also purge synctokens which can be significant to the overall storage consumed by a room. Room version 1 and 2 support took a step forward, possibly working for some rooms but is not yet considered reliable. Thanks to AreYouLoco for contributing an updated Kubernetes [Helm Chart](https://github.com/AreYouLoco/tuwunel-helm).
> 
> #### 🐞 Bug Fixes
> 
> * Special thanks to freb1b for investigating a bug which triggers the uploading of unnecessary one-time encryption keys. Running over ten maubot instances it became obvious after observing increased resources and laggy bot response. This update removes any excess keys for a device. Thanks to duckbuster for confirming neochat is affected. Clients confirmed unaffected include: Element, Element X, Nheko. Fractal, Cinny, matrix-rust-sdk and matrix-js-sdk clients and bots are probably unaffected.
> * Thanks d4sha_uwu for refactoring alias resolution logic to remain compatible with the upcoming element-web release. This was an incredibly valuable contribution which will spare all of us from impending grief.
> 
> Room deletions now preserve a small number of records to properly synchronize with local clients and remote servers after the room vanishes; prior behavior is maintained with a `--force` flag added to the command. Specification compliance required the `/joined_rooms` endpoint be restricted to current members rather than including past members. Specification compliance required state events be made visible to prior members of a room where `history_visibility=shared`. The limit parameter to the `/context` endpoint is now divided with de facto compatibility [matrix-org/matrix-spec#2202](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec/issues/2202). The room avatar in sliding sync is now computed with greater compliance to the specification; this builds off earlier work done by tyler. The canonical alias for a room is considered invalid if the primary alias is missing or removed. Presence is no longer updated by the private read-receipt or read-marker paths, only public receipts.

### Synapse ([website](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/))

Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by Element.

[Andrew Morgan (anoa) {he/him}](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io) says

> The release of Synapse v1.139.0rc1 is running behind this week due to fixing [a release blocker](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/issues/18925). Expect it to land early next week, with the full release a few days after that once folks have had a chance to test it.
> 
> Otherwise the team continues to work on refactoring the codebase to improve logging in a multi-tenant configuration, as well as begin to advertise support for newer Matrix spec versions (Synapse currently only advertises v12 and below).

## Dept of Clients 📱

### Element X Android ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-android))

Android Matrix messenger application using the Matrix Rust SDK and Jetpack Compose.

[Jorge](https://matrix.to/#/@jorgem:element.io) reports

> Another week, another TWIM. This week the work on Element X Android has been around:
> * Spaces, spaces, spaces. Lots of work related to spaces, the feature is slowly but steadily taking shape.
> * Threads: same as with spaces, we're working on finishing the work so the threads features matches the experience on the classic Element apps so we can later iterate on that and improve it.
> * Element Call: tested some integrations of the latest changes in Element Call for a better UX.
> * F-Droid is back! After fighting some external issues for quite a while reproducible builds are working again so [v25.09.1 was released](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/io.element.android.x/).
> * Multi-account work is progressing too!

## Dept of Ops 🛠

### Matrix Connectivity Tester

[MTRNord (they/them)](https://matrix.to/#/@mtrnord:mtrnord.blog) reports

> We got a new release. It mainly added support for (anonymized) statistics to be gathered.
> 
> The statistics are opt-in on a request level. HS level opt-in is deemed out of scope at this time due to the complexity this would have brought. However, opt-out for an HS can be done on request using an issue on either repo.
> 
> On a technical level, this stores some request results in a database in its raw format and also the aggregation data. It then provides a `/metrics` endpoint in Prometheus text format, and uses salted blake3 hashes to anonymize the server_name in the data. It offers currently the client side announced unstable features as well as server types and versions.
> 
> Additionally, over at the UI there is now a "Statistics" tab trying to visualize the data.
> 
> You are welcome to try it over at <https://connectivity-tester.mtrnord.blog/statistics> and report issues at <https://github.com/MTRNord/rust-federation-tester> and <https://github.com/MTRNord/matrix-connection-tester-ui> respectively.

## Dept of Bots 🤖

### maubot ([website](https://github.com/maubot/maubot))

A plugin-based Matrix bot system.

[tulir](https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net) announces

> maubot v0.6.0b1 and mautrix-python v0.21.0b4 support verifying their own device by using an existing recovery key or generating a new one, which means they're ready for [MSC4153](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4153)

## Dept of Events and Talks 🗣️

### FITKO Neo Hackathon

[Marco](https://matrix.to/#/@marcoh___:tchncs.de) reports

> Greetings from [Krems (Danube)](<https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q131266>)! We spent the first week of the workation hacking on an end-to-end encrypted Matrix-powered government-to-citizen communication solution. During the last days, we fought demo-grade keycloak setup, built a Rust-powered Matrix web client for citizen communication and an iOS app for citizens. We also did a lot of brainstorming and planning together with Germany's [Federal IT Cooperation](<https://www.fitko.de/>) and Germany's [Federal Ministry for Digital Transformation and Government Modernisation](<https://bmds.bund.de/>). [Our location](<https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/5354279170>) provided opportunities for walks in the vineyards, great food and music during the night. We (still unsuccessfully) fought Apple support while trying to register an organization with a German [umlaut](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umlaut_(diacritic)>), enjoyed the community and mixed some new Spezi variations [Editor's note: in turn with [~~Element~~ Korl](https://www.zwettler.at/sortiment/#korl)]. 🍾
> 
> The week provides a great starting point for the next iterations of our app and web client that will hopefully skyrocket Germany's next generation user interface to the public administration.
> 
> The project is 100% free and open source software and contributes into the existing Matrix ecosystem. Details about that project can be found on the project's [dedicated openCode info repository](<https://gitlab.opencode.de/fitko/matrix-g2x/>).
