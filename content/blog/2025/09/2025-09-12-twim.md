## Dept of *Status of Matrix* 🌡️

### Governing Board ([website](https://matrix.org/foundation/governing-board/))

The Governing Board is an advisory board to the Matrix.org Foundation and with elected representatives from all across the Matrix ecosystem.

[HarHarLinks](https://matrix.to/#/@kim:sosnowkadub.de) reports

> This week I'm excited to share some quick transparency update from the Governing Board. Together with the Website & Content Working Group, we have updated the Governing Board area of the matrix.org homepage, adding more info about the Governing Board's current Committees! We have mentioned the Committees before and named them on the website. The Committee names are mostly speaking for themselves, but one of the goals in open governance is transparency, not guessing. 😉 So we have just added a new subpage at <https://matrix.org/foundation/governing-board/committees/> where you can now find each Committee's charter, members, and meeting schedule.
> 
> We have also tweaked the main Governing Board page, restructuring the info about the [elected representatives](https://matrix.org/foundation/governing-board/#elected-representatives) and [chairs](https://matrix.org/foundation/governing-board/#current-chairs-of-the-governing-board) visually to be easier to grasp in the context of Foundation member constituencies and Committees respectively. Give it a whirl, and as always hit us with any questions about the Governing Board over at the [#governing-board-office:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#governing-board-office:matrix.org)!

> 
> In line our quarterly release schedule, the Matrix 1.16 release is soon due. In parallel, the Spec Core Team is working to land as many [Matrix 2.0-labeled MSCs](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pulls?q=is%3Aopen%20is%3Apr%20label%3Amatrix-2.0) ahead of [the upcoming Matrix 2025 conference](https://2025.matrix.org/). This is only an aspiration, and the MSCs will not be rushed to meet this deadline.
> 
> If you'd like to help with the effort, or would like to see a given MSC land in Matrix 1.16, feel free to drop us a message in the [Office of the Spec Core Team](https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org) room on Matrix.

[andybalaam](https://matrix.to/#/@andybalaam:matrix.org) reports

> ### Stitched ordering update
> 
> I've been [banging on about message ordering](https://artificialworlds.net/blog/2024/12/04/message-order-in-matrix/) for a while now, but recently Rich and I tried to do something about it by working on a [design for providing messages in a consistent order](https://codeberg.org/andybalaam/stitched-order).
> 
> We recently made an attempt at implementing this design, and I wanted to give a small update on how it went. We worked in the Synapse codebase and prototyped adding a column to the `events` table that could represent the "stitched" order of each event. As expected, we encountered some practical difficulties, but we eventually managed to get sensible orders inserted into the table. The next step will be to return events in that order from the various APIs. We'll send more updates if/when we make more progress!
> 
> Why do this? Read the links above for the full story, but the short answer is that with the current behaviour, Matrix clients can become confused about what order things happened in a room, and this can lead to nasty problems like stuck unread rooms or stuck notifications, among other things. Our plan for "stitched" ordering should make sure clients always see messages in the same order from the server. You can find out a bit more by watching a [recent episode of Matrix Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aTaUcBpXks)!

## Dept of Clients 📱

### Element X Android ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-android))

Android Matrix messenger application using the Matrix Rust SDK and Jetpack Compose.

[Jorge](https://matrix.to/#/@jorgem:element.io) says

> Hi everyone, this week on the Element X Android team we've been focused on:
> 
> * Spaces: while it's still behind a feature flag, it's slowly taking shape and now you can explore the spaces you've already joined using a separate tab in the app.
> * Trying to fix F-Droid: we haven't been able to make the F-Droid builds work for a while, first because of an issue with the dependency injection we were using, then with the Android Gradle Plugin used to build the app. Both of these issues have been addressed, so we hope a new F-Droid version will be available soon 🤞.
> * The notifications for rooms are now set as conversations, and recently used rooms can be added as a shortcut to your home screen.
> * Emoji search for reactions: this was a feature that was request quite some time ago, but we couldn't fit into our planning. However, we managed to find some time to actually implement this, we hope you like it!

[Ivan 🦀](https://matrix.to/#/@mnt_io:matrix.org) announces

> Hello folks! Progresses are being made in every directions. Let's dive, would you?
>

> 
> * [#5635](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5635) Fix a panic in the `RoomMember::normalized_power_level` method.
> * [#5656](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5656) Create the CVE.

> ### Media live in their own store
> 
> It's been a moment we want to split the event cache store ([#5410](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues/5410)). It contains 2 kind of data: the event cache, and the media. The problem is that this store is pretty busy. It leads to “this database is busy”, or “this database is locked” error in SQLite ([#5362](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues/5362)). To solve this problem, we have reduced the number of concurrent write accesses to this store ([#5382](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5382)). It has reduced the occurrence of errors greatly ([#5362-c3200020959](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues/5362#issuecomment-3200020959)). However, this is not entirely done, and we believe extracting the media into their own store would help solving the last occurrences of this problem.
> 
> * [#5568](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5568) Split media store from event cache store.
> * [#5655](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5655) Drop media SQLite table from event cache store.
> 
> ### Search
> 
> Last week, we briefly talked about a new crate: `matrix-sdk-search`. It implements a search engine for Matrix, and we hope to soon see it embeded in many clients. Progresses have been made on that front, with an improved implementation inside `multiverse`, our developer- and debug-oriented Matrix client.
> 
> * [#5659](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5659) Add `get_room_events` to `EventCacheStore` trait, allowing the initial indexing to be posible.
> * [#5634](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5634) Allow to paginate through search's results when many.
> * [#5629](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5629) Implementing the search engine in `multiverse`.
> 
> ### Latest Event
> 
> The new Latest Event API is still blocked by the _re-decryption happens in the Event Cache_ project. Meanwhile, we've been able to merge a couple of other patches to polish the implementation:
> 
> * [#5617](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5617) Add the new `latest_event` room list sorter, and update the `recency` sorter. This helps to put the rooms with a local latest event value at the top of the room list, and to sort rooms based on their latest event recency stamp.
> * [#5648](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5648) Partially protect against malicious `origin_server_ts`. This was a long standing issue. We took the opportunity of working on this project to fix this issue.
> * [#5665](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5665/) Clear the Event Cache so that all new events stored in it are protected against malicious `origin_server_ts`.
> 
> ### Badge counter
> 
> Are you aware of _app icon badge notification count is wrong_ on iOS ([element-x-ios#3151](https://github.com/element-hq/element-x-ios/issues/3151))? It personally drives me nuts. We are fully aware that it drives many people crazy, and for good reasons! Wait no more, we are finally working on it! The fix on itself isn't particularly complex, but it required —and still requires a bit of— upstream non-trivial work, notably around the cross-process lock. Why that? Because on iOS, the process for the app isn't the same as the process for the notification. We have to ensure mutually exclusive access to the underlying stores. That's why we've implemented a cross-process lock. But we need more.
> 
> * [#4874](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues/4874) The meta issue about the cross-process lock improvements
> * [#5653](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5653) The first step to generalise the cross-process lock. The next step is to introduce _poison_ (next week!).
> 
> ### Shared recent emojis
> 
> During our hackathon, someone has implemented the _shared recent emojis_ feature. Now it has landed inside the Matrix Rust SDK. With this feature, we can sync recently used emojis between clients (notably Element Web and Element X). The list is sorted by recency of usage and also contains the number of times the emoji has been used in case we want to use that to filter out the items in the future.
> 
> * [#5641](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5641) Add recent emojis for shared emoji reactions.
> 
> ### Technical article of the week
> 
> We want to publish technical articles about what we do in the Matrix Rust SDK. We hope you will enjoy reading them. They aim at deep diving in the details of some bugs, performance improvements, or various novelties. This week, the article is:
