## Dept of *Status of Matrix* 🌡️

[HarHarLinks](https://matrix.to/#/@kim:sosnowkadub.de) reports

> ### matrix.org Website
> 
> 2 weeks after the [last update](https://matrix.org/blog/2025/09/12/this-week-in-matrix-2025-09-12/#governing-board-website) at the Website & Content Working Group we have some new updates worth mentioning:
> 
> The new ecosystem page listing [distributions](https://matrix.org/ecosystem/distributions/) has landed!
> We consider a Matrix distribution a collection of software related to Matrix that is deployed and automatically configured so the different pieces integrate with one another. Click the link to find some examples!
> 
> In organisational news, you may have noticed the Working Group is not just called "Website", but "Website & Content". This is because the WG is not only responsible for making sure the website works on a technical level, but also maintaining its content. Of course this also includes making sure that any contributions to the website are as good as they can reasonably be. One of our first big topics behind the scenes was thus the creation of the [Review & Publishing Policy](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#review--publishing-policy) to try and set a bar we think we can meet, and as well as expectations that Working Group and contributors may assume of each other. The Governing Board has recommended to the Foundation to approve this policy, and it is now added to our repository's CONTRIBUTING.md alongside the already existing guidelines!
> Next step: set up GitHub to support as much of this as possible with automation.
> 
> Of course that's only the big news. For the rest, check our [commitlog](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/commits/main/commitlog) or follow the Hookshot announcements in our public room [#matrix.org-website:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#matrix.org-website:matrix.org)!

## Dept of Spec 📜

[Andrew Morgan (anoa) {he/him}](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io) reports

> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <https://spec.matrix.org/proposals>.
> 
> 
> ### MSC Status
> 
> **New MSCs:**
> * [MSC4362: Simplified Encrypted State Events](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4362)
> * [MSC4361: Non-federating Membership Authentication Rule Amendments](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4361)
> 
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
> * *No MSCs are in FCP.*
> 
> **Accepted MSCs:**
> * *No MSCs were accepted this week.*
> 
> **Closed MSCs:**
> * [MSC4317: Signed profile data](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4317)
>     * Initially motivated by a custom enterprise use case, but could not be made generic enough to apply to the wider ecosystem.
> * [MSC4316: External cross-signing signatures with X.509 certificates and (semi-)automated verification](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4316)
> 	* Similar story to the above.
> * [MSC3761: State event change control](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3761)
> 	* Abandoned by the author.
> 
> ### Spec Updates
> 
> Following the release of [Matrix 1.16](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.16) last week, the SCT have continued to iterate on the MSC labelled [Matrix 2.0](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3Amatrix-2.0). It will be exciting to start seeing these proposals land as they cover very exciting features for the protocol (sliding sync, MatrixRTC, OAuth, etc.).
> 
> Keep an eye out as the authors and the SCT continue to drive them to conclusion.

## Dept of Servers 🏢



### Synapse ([website](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/))

Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by Element.

[Andrew Morgan (anoa) {he/him}](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io) announces

> ### Element Synapse
> 
> It's been quite the week of releases in Synapse land. Synapse [1.139.0rc2](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/releases/tag/v1.139.0rc2) and [1.139.0rc3](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/releases/tag/v1.139.0rc3) were put out ahead of the planned 1.139.0 release next week. Please try 1.139.0rc3 out (if you're able to) and file any bugs or regressions you find on [our issue tracker](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/).
> 
> In parallel, Synapse [1.138.2](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/releases/tag/v1.138.2) was released with a performance fix for the delayed events feature. Performance could suffer even if the feature was not used, so be sure to update if you're having performance issues on 1.138.0 (which was when the regression was introduced). The 1.139.0 release candidates also include the fix.
> 
> Please note that all of the above releases have dropped support for Ubuntu 24.10 Oracular Oriole as it is end-of-life. Support for Ubuntu 25.04 Plucky Puffin was added in its place.

### continuwuity ([website](https://continuwuity.org/))

Continuwuity is a community-driven Matrix homeserver in Rust.

[nex (it/she) 🏳️‍⚧️](https://matrix.to/#/@nex:nexy7574.co.uk) announces

> ### Continuwuity v0.5.0-rc.8
> 
> **Author's note:** Since the release of this version, several bugs in the new state resolution have been found; it is advised you wait for the full 0.5.0 release for v12 rooms unless you need them _today_.
> 
> Nobody told me I'd need a durable keyboard when we forked 😟
> Hey everyone! And everytwo, I see you. Regardless of the number of every you are, there's a continuwuity 0.5.0 rc8 release near you! All of you!
> 
> In the past month or so, we've **merged 86 pull requests**, closed 12 issues, and across **142 commits**, **modified 180 files** with a net 9,650 changes! And the best part is, this isn't even an on-schedule release. In order to get room v12 support ready in anticipation of several prominent communities upgrading their communal spaces, we've ended up pulling this release out of the oven a little earlier than we had hoped. As such, there's not as many new things as we usually add, but that's okay, because sometimes, less is more. Plus the things we _did_ fit in are pretty kickass.
> 
> There's an awful lot to go through, so I'll just summarise the eye-catchy things. You can see _everything_ via the [rc8 milestone](https://forgejo.ellis.link/continuwuation/continuwuity/milestone/40).
> 
> * ✨ **Room v12 support!** ([#943](https://forgejo.ellis.link/continuwuation/continuwuity/issues/943))
> * 🔐 LDAP login ([#921](https://forgejo.ellis.link/continuwuation/continuwuity/issues/921))
> * 📵 MSC4155 invite filtering ([#1013](https://forgejo.ellis.link/continuwuation/continuwuity/issues/1013))
> * 📤 Leaving a room now reliably tells clients it happened ([#959](https://forgejo.ellis.link/continuwuation/continuwuity/issues/959))
> * 🔎 You have greater control over your join vias! ([#956](https://forgejo.ellis.link/continuwuation/continuwuity/issues/956))
> 
> Huge thank you to the >10 individual contributors who have gone out of their way to directly help with the project, including huge changes to our CI system and amazing packaging fixes and changes, as well as everyone else who beta test changes before they make a release. The project quite literally would not be the same without you 🫶
> 
> #### Where?!
> 
> **You can download the latest release [on our forge](https://forgejo.ellis.link/continuwuation/continuwuity/releases/tag/v0.5.0-rc.8)**. Docker images are also available using [`forgejo.ellis.link/continuwuation/continuwuity:latest`](https://forgejo.ellis.link/continuwuation/-/packages/container/continuwuity/latest).
> If you're daring, we also now have _maxperf_ builds, which take advantage of some optimisations in modern CPUs (generally, anything newer than haswell). Use the `conduwuit-haswell-linux-amd64-maxperf` binary, or docker tag [`forgejo.ellis.link/continuwuation/continuwuity:sha-b70470f-maxperf`](https://forgejo.ellis.link/continuwuation/-/packages/container/continuwuity/sha-b70470f-maxperf). You probably won't notice a difference since continuwuity is super fast anyway, but hey, numbers!
> 
> We also mirror our release OCI images to GitLab: <https://gitlab.com/continuwuity/continuwuity/container_registry/8871720>
> 
> We don't currently mirror our releases anywhere yet, however, our source code is also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/continuwuity/continuwuity), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/continuwuity/continuwuity/), and [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/continuwuity/continuwuity). A few members of the community also mirror, some include releases, so if you have issues with any/all of the forges above, don't hesitate to join our community (below) and ask!
> 
> #### What's next ✨
> 
> You can also [#main:continuwuity.org](https://matrix.to/#/#main:continuwuity.org), and explore our [#space:continuwuity.org](https://matrix.to/#/#space:continuwuity.org), where we have a room for important announcements, a rich offtopic room, and our dev room where we discuss features and bugs.
> If you run your own continuwuity server, you should also [#announcements:continuwuity.org](https://matrix.to/#/#announcements:continuwuity.org), as important announcements are sent there (and may not be mirrored to the main room).
> 
> Anyway, as per usual, most things we're planning to tackle are [on our issue tracker](https://forgejo.ellis.link/continuwuation/continuwuity/issues), or in a [pull request](https://forgejo.ellis.link/continuwuation/continuwuity/pulls).

### Matrix Authentication Service ([website](https://github.com/element-hq/matrix-authentication-service))

Matrix Authentication Service (MAS) is an OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Provider server developed by Element.

[Andrew Morgan (anoa) {he/him}](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io) says

> [MAS 1.3.0](https://github.com/element-hq/matrix-authentication-service/releases/tag/v1.3.0) was released this week!
> 
> This release makes a few changes to the Admin API to make MAS easier to administrate from third-party tooling, as well as adds some more commands to mas-cli. Check the link for the full changelog.

## Dept of Clients 📱



### Fractal ([website](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/fractal))

Matrix messaging app for GNOME written in Rust.

[Kévin Commaille](https://matrix.to/#/@zecakeh:tedomum.net) reports

> What is better for celebrating the season change than to test what is going to be in the next version of Fractal? Fractal 13.beta was released just for that, and it brings:
> 
> * A brand new audio player that loads files lazily and displays the audio stream as a seekable waveform.
> * Only a single file with an audio stream can be played at a time, which means that clicking on a "Play" button stops the previous media player that was playing.
> * Clicking on the avatar of the sender of a message now opens directly the user profile instead of a context menu. The actions that were in the context menu could already be performed from that dialog, so UX is more straightforward now.
> * The GNOME document and monospace fonts are used for messages.
> * Most of our UI definitions got ported to Blueprint.
> 
> As usual, this release includes other improvements, fixes and new translations thanks to all our contributors, and our upstream projects.
> 
> It is available to install via Flathub Beta, see the [instructions in our README](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/fractal#installation-instructions).
> 
> As the version implies, there might be a slight risk of regressions, but it should be mostly stable. If all goes well the next step is the release candidate!
> 
> If you have a little bit of time on your hands, you can try to fix one of our [newcomers issues](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/fractal/-/issues/?label_name%5B%5D=4.%20Newcomers). Anyone can make Fractal better!

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰



### matrix-rust-sdk ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk))

Your all-in-one toolkit for creating Matrix clients with Rust, from simple bots to full-featured apps, with bindings to Swift, Kotlin, WebAssembly, Go and more, sponsored by Element.

[Ivan 🦀](https://matrix.to/#/@mnt_io:matrix.org) announces

> <em lang="fr">Bonjour</em> everyone! The fog is trying to demoralise the team, but it doesn't affect the pace of bug fixes, performance improvements, and new features! Let's help ourselves with our best tea, sit comfortably, and see what happened recently.
> 
> ### Space
> 
> Rooms can be organised in Spaces. It's a nice way for group of people with many rooms to create a hierarchy of rooms. The Matrix Rust SDK is implementing a new Space API.
> 
> - [#5717](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5717) The FFI bindings were exposing the `NonSpace` filter for the Room List. Now it also exposes the `Space` filter, allowing to display the top-level spaces.
> - [#5712](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5712) The Space List now receives live updates.
> - [#5663](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5663) It is much easier to navigate from the parent to the children, and vice versa, and get a Space List at each step.
> 
> ### Thread
> 
> Threads help to have discussions attached to messages. The Matrix Rust SDK is implementing a new Thread API. The work this week has been around supporting permalinks to a thread or to a threaded message.
> 
> - [#5709](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5709) Remove an undesired behaviour in the Timeline: when it was focused on a threaded event, the Timeline was receiving live updates.
> - [#5678](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5678) It is now possible to paginate around a specific event inside a thread with the Timeline.
> 
> ### Crypto
> 
> The `matrix-sdk-crypto` crate is receiving a couple of bug fixes.
> 
> - [#5699](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5699) Add the new `has_devices_to_verify_against` function to check if the user has another device to verify against in order to cross-sign their new device. The device must be signed by the user's cross-signing key, must have an identity, and must not be a dehydrated device.
> - [#5666](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5666) Report inner-outer state key differences as invalid.
> 
> ### Latest Event
> 
> The Latest Event API allows to find and display the latest event of a room or a thread. It's used in the Room List for the moment. Last week, we've spent quite a lot of time digging a complex bug around the Room List `recency` sorter and the Latest Event.
> 
> - [#5698](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5698) The `recency` sorter of the Room List is now using the Latest Event's timestamp, with a fallback to the room recency stamp (the old behaviour, which could be wrong because computed by sliding sync server-side —the `bump_stamp` value—, with sometimes unexpected values).
> - [#5673](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5673) The `LatestEvents` is lazy. It computes `LatestEvent` only for rooms that are _listened_. One can listen to rooms manually. However, after the Room List that was registering Latest Event listeners automatically, it's now time for the Sync to do the same, making the whole Latest Event API almost a no-op. It should be very rare for someone to listen to a room manually now.
> 
> ### Room List
> 
> The Room List is an API helping to display a list of rooms.
> 
> - While trying to fix a bug where 3 CPU cores were fanning at 100% (usually, the sign something bad is happening right?), we have improved the performance and fixed a bug in `eyeball`, happy collateral damages:
>     - [#5684](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5684) Improve performance of the `RoomList` by +765%.
>     - [eyeball#80](https://github.com/jplatte/eyeball/pull/80) Fix an infinite loop when `SortBy<Stream<Item = T>>` handles a `VectorDiff::Set` where `T` is a shallow clone type.
> - [#5618](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5618) Enable the thread subscriptions extension based on server support, otherwise, when running against a server that doesn't support thread subscriptions, the client may falsely think that its thread subscriptions are not outdated (when receiving an empty, defaulted `ThreadSubscriptions` section in the SSS response). As a result, it would always use the store, not find most thread subscriptions, and conclude “nope, you haven't subscribed to any thread”, which is wrong.
> 
> ### Search
> 
> `matrix-sdk-search` is a new crate implementing a search engine for all the events received by your favorite client.
> 
> - [#5694](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5694) This crate now has a nice `README.md`!
> - [#5691](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5691) The search index file is now encrypted! Security, safety and privacy are not just fancy words.
> 
> ### Media in IndexedDB
> 
> - [#5682](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5682) It is now possible to get, add, replace and remove media from the `MediaStore` in IndexedDB.
> 
> ### RTC
> 
> Real-Time Communication. The base for video and audio calls via Matrix.
> 
> - [#5668](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5668) Remove the deprecated `CallNotify` event in favour of the `RtcNotification` event.
> 
> ### Timeline
> 
> The Timeline is what arranges all the events of a room nicely.
> 
> - [#5640](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5640) The Timeline can now handle custom events. That's a long-time requested feature. Welcome here!
> 
> ### General
> 
> For contributions that fit in no category but are important.
> 
> - [#5683](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5683) Recently, we've introduced a way to fetch the “most recent used emojis” when reacting to a message. Now the number of emojis are limited to 100 to avoid growing the list indefinitely.
> - [#5621](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5621) The room notification modes will only change when the push rules change; otherwise, recomputing them is a no-op, and only wastes time. And it was a waste a time. With this patch, room notification is 4000% faster.


### libQuotient ([website](https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient))

A Qt6 library to write cross-platform clients for Matrix

[kitsune](https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org) says

> The new version in the stable branch is out; release notes are in [the usual place](https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/releases/tag/0.9.5). This release fixes a crash; unfortunately, it's not enough to just sneak in the new library version to fix it though, you actually have to recompile (no code changes needed) your client. Which is why **packagers** are strongly encouraged to build not just this version of libQuotient but also rebuild the clients depending on it (Quaternion and NeoChat, in particular).

### Matrix Connectivity Tester

[MTRNord (they/them)](https://matrix.to/#/@mtrnord:mtrnord.blog) announces

> This week we have 2 new updates:
> 
> First of all I resolved an issue which prevented users to subscribe to more than one Homeserver using a single email address. This now should work correctly.
> 
> Second of all, there is now a visual representation under the Pipeline tab which is somewhat similar to a GitLab pipeline. This is a goal to make it more approachable to non-technical users. Please note that this is the first iteration of this feature. Therefore, there are some known bugs like the arrows taking a very long time to appear. Help to fix this would be appreciated since with React 19 + react compiler it seems to have gotten quite hard to get this working as the arrows rely on the cards to be laid out in the DOM for calculations.
> 
> ![A schema showing the server discovery pipeline used by the connectivity tester. A first box contains "Input validation", then points to a second called "Well-Known results", that itself points to a third called "SRV Results", that in turn points to a final fourth "Federation Result."](/blog/img/server-discovery-pipeline.png)
> 
> You can as usual check out the code at <https://github.com/MTRNord/rust-federation-tester/> and <https://github.com/MTRNord/matrix-connection-tester-ui/>
> Or use it at <https://connectivity-tester.mtrnord.blog/>

## Dept of Bots 🤖

[HarHarLinks](https://matrix.to/#/@kim:sosnowkadub.de) reports

> [matrix-reminder-bot v0.4.0](https://github.com/anoadragon453/matrix-reminder-bot/releases/tag/v0.4.0)!
> 
> This release has been simmering for a while. Rather than features, it brings some quality of life improvements to existing features.
> 
> Creating reminders is now more sane; you can't set a reminder for a few minutes ago any more and daylight saving time zone handling was improved to calculate the right offset year-round.
> When inviting the bot to an existing room with recent messages, the bot will not anymore try to read and react to them, which would previously fail especially in encrypted rooms.
> 
> From the technical side, all dependencies have been updated, and Python 3.12 is now supported.
> We have also added the GitHub container registry to our release CI, making releases available from both Docker Hub and GHCR at your choice.
> 
> Thanks to all who contributed to this release: [@svierne](https://github.com/svierne), [@th0mcat](https://github.com/th0mcat), [@cyb3rko](https://github.com/cyb3rko)!

## Dept of Events and Talks 🗣️

[mcnesium](https://matrix.to/#/@mcnesium:exma.de) reports

> I gave a talk (in German) on Matrix at the annual Chaos event [Datenspuren](https://datenspuren.de). It is designed for beginners and focuses on overcoming entry hurdles, but also brings up talking points on *why* we want it, more than for example Signal. Spoiler: Decentralization is the only key against tech authoritarianism.
