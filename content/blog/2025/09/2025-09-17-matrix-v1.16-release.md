Hey all,

Today’s [Matrix 1.16](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.16) release brings two major features to the protocol: [**extensible profiles**](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.16/client-server-api/#profiles) and [**room version 12**](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.16/rooms/v12/) from [Project Hydra](@/blog/2025/08/2025-08-14-project-hydra-improving-state-res.md)! With room version 12, users should see fewer “state resets” and a clearer hierarchy for power levels in the room. The [Project Hydra blog post](@/blog/2025/08/2025-08-14-project-hydra-improving-state-res.md) covers the changes in more detail, so this post will focus on extensible profiles and our plan for Matrix 2.0.

As always, the full changelog and descriptions of the 9 MSCs released today is at the end of this post.

## Extensible profiles

Since the invention of profiles, people have wanted to advertise information to others. Matrix is no different, with time zones, pronouns, preferred languages, job titles, and more being among the top requested dedicated fields. Matrix 1.16 brings time zone support to ensure the new extensible system is capable of representing basic information. However users are able to use custom namespaces today to describe additional details, whereas new MSCs may formally define fields to be added to the specification for broad client support.

Huge thanks and congratulations to Tom for landing this highly requested feature in their [first-ever MSC](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4133).

## Matrix 2.0

Over the years we’ve [talked](@/blog/2023/09/2023-09-21-matrix-2-0.md) a lot about Matrix 2.0, and even [demoed](@/blog/2024/10/2024-10-29-matrix-2.0-is-here.md) the implementations of Matrix 2.0 MSCs at last year’s Matrix Conference. After spending the majority of the last year polishing the implementations and touching up the MSCs, we’re setting our sights on Matrix 2.0. If we’re lucky, we’ll even get the [12+ remaining MSCs](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3Amatrix-2.0) merged before the [Matrix Conference](https://conference.matrix.org/) in October.

Watch this space and the [Office of the Matrix Spec Core Team](https://matrix.to/#/#sct-office:matrix.org) room on Matrix for updates as we work toward Matrix 2.0/the conference.
