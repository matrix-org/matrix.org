## Dept of Trust & Safety ⚖️

### Draupnir4All ([website](https://docs.draupnir.midnightthoughts.space/))

[MTRNord (they/them)](https://matrix.to/#/@mtrnord:mtrnord.blog) says

> Hi,
> 
> small and not so positive update:
> 
> Due to things going on which I can't get into, I will not take new applications to Draupnir4All. Additionally, I plan to shut down the system at the end of the year. I suggest looking for alternatives, as I am unlikely to extend this timeframe.
> 
> I am at this time not aware of alternatives beyond selfhosting a draupnir. Draupnir4All is selfhostable by anyone via the appservice module of draupnir however.

### Pre-announcing asgard.chat

[tulir](https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net) reports

> We (Cat, Sky and I) are setting up a new server to help replace MTRNord's Draupnir4All service. Asgard will offer both Meowlnir and Draupnir instances to room admins who need a moderation bot, but can't host one themselves (or who want a secondary bot as backup). Expect more news in the coming weeks.

## Dept of Clients 📱

### Element X iOS ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios))

A total rewrite of Element iOS using the Matrix Rust SDK underneath and targeting devices running iOS 16+.

[Mauro Romito](https://matrix.to/#/@mauro.romito:element.io) announces

> * More A11y improvements have been added to the app
> * Improved the memory management of the app, we recently fixed a possible memory leak that could happen when clearing the cache
> * Added a long press action in the media timeline so that you can bring up a context menu
> * Spaces work is going great! We made great progress, and implemented a way to navigate between your chats and spaces through a tab view
> * Work on thread is going further we are now improving them alongside the sliding sync from synapse, so that is possible for the sliding sync to keep track of the thread you are participating and receive a notification for them, as a reply one.

### Element X Android ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-android))

Android Matrix messenger application using the Matrix Rust SDK and Jetpack Compose.

[Benoit](https://matrix.to/#/@benoit.marty:matrix.org) announces

> * Making progress on Spaces
> * We change our dependency injection library to Metro. It should fix various issues that we observed during compilation
> * Also creating a Pull Request to add a first implementation of multi accounts. The feature is still experimental, do not enable the flag if you're unsure!
> * and last but not least, we will have soon an enhanced emoji picker, to be able to search for emoji, have a list of recently used emoji and a emoji completion directly in the composer!

## Dept of Encryption 🔐

### Element Crypto Team update

[andybalaam](https://matrix.to/#/@andybalaam:matrix.org) says

> As well as Invisible Crypto (which we talked about in a recent TWIM), the Element Crypto Team is also working on History Sharing.
> 
> #### What is History Sharing?
> 
> When you join an encrypted room, wouldn't it be nice if you could read the old messages that were sent before you joined?
> 
> (Of course, only if the room's settings say it's OK. In detail: only if the person sending the message understood this to be allowed at the exact moment they sent it!)
> 
> To be able to read these old messages, you will need to have the relevant message keys, which means someone needs to send them to you.
> 
> History sharing is about securely getting those old keys to a new member of an existing encrypted room, so they can scroll up and see what people were saying.
> 
> #### What have we been doing?
> 
> We have an early prototype up and running!
> 
> NOTE: it is not ready for fully secure use yet, so only use it in test environments!
> 
> We've added an experimental "labs" flag to Element Web and Element X that allows you to play with the feature.
> 
> If you and the other person both have the labs flag turned on, you can invite them to an encrypted room (with "Who can read history" set to "Members only (since the point in time of selecting this option)") and, along with the invite you will automatically send all the keys they need.
> 
> If it all works as planned, they will be able to see old messages as soon as they join the room. (If not, bug reports are welcome!)
> 
> #### What is coming next?
> 
> As mentioned, this is just an early prototype, and in particular, we have not implemented all the protections we need to be happy about all the security aspects.
> 
> So the next step is to fill in all those protections and make sure we have a robust solution.
> 
> After that, we will begin working on how to handle situations where people are not explicitly invited to a room (e.g. if they join through a space).
> 
> There's lots of work still to do, but we are making good progress on this important feature. You can follow along and contribute at <https://github.com/element-hq/element-meta/issues/2829>.
> 
> If you'd like to talk to us, you can find us hanging out in the Matrix support rooms for the Element clients and servers - see you there!

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰

### Ruma ([website](https://ruma.dev))

A set of Rust library crates for working with the Matrix protocol. Ruma’s approach to Matrix emphasizes correctness, security, stability and performance.

[Kévin Commaille](https://matrix.to/#/@zecakeh:tedomum.net) reports

> Ruma keeps growing and improving, as can be seen with our new [0.13.0](https://github.com/ruma/ruma/releases/tag/ruma-0.13.0) release! We had several patch releases since 0.12.0, but this one includes a fair amount of breaking changes for your own good 😉. Some interesting changes are:
> 
> * Support for Matrix 1.13, 1.14 and 1.15, including the OAuth 2.0 server metadata endpoint and rich room topics.
> * ruma-client was moved to its own repository and is no longer re-exported by ruma, because it is not being actively worked on. It will still be maintained and kept up-to-date with the latest release of ruma.
> * We got rid of the `unstable-unspecified` cargo feature, which means that everything that was behind it was clarified in the Matrix spec, yay!
> * The `RoomVersion` type that lists all tweaks between room versions, like for authorization rules or for redaction, was moved from ruma-state-res to ruma-common as `RoomVersionRules`, allowing clients to use it too instead of having to match on the room versions.
> * We also gained support for new exciting MSCs like room language ([MSC4334](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4334)) and thread subscriptions ([MSC4306](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4306) & [MSC4308](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4308)). 
> 
> We want to thank all our contributors! If you want to join them, take a look at one of our ["help wanted" issues](https://github.com/ruma/ruma/labels/help%20wanted), or implement an MSC that you care about.

### matrix-rust-sdk ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk))

Your all-in-one toolkit for creating Matrix clients with Rust, from simple bots to full-featured apps, with bindings to Swift, Kotlin, WebAssembly, Go and more, sponsored by Element.

[Ivan 🦀](https://matrix.to/#/@mnt_io:matrix.org) reports

> 5 weeks. Who said time flies? A non-negligible portion of the team was taking a (too hot) summer break. It doesn't mean nothing happened though. Fasten your jetpack to fly over the biggest changes with me.
> 
> #### A release!
> 
> First off, we have a new 0.14 release \o/. See the [changelog](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/blob/main/crates/matrix-sdk/CHANGELOG.md#0140---2025-09-04).
> 
> #### Space
> 
> _Bip bip_, _bip bip_. What's this echo? Is it… an alien? It's coming from 🌟 Space 🌟! Yes, you heard it. Support for Space has landed in the Matrix Rust SDK. It's an early implementation, there is more to come, but you can already play with it in Element X nightlies.
> 
> * [#5509](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5509) The big set of patches!
> * [#5479](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5479) Ask for spaces in sliding sync.
> 
> #### Thread
> 
> Threads are making great progresses, with a focus on subscriptions to receive notifications.
> 
> * [#5590](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5590) and [#5604](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5604) Implement [MSC4308](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4308).
> * [#5462](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5462) Automatically subscribe a user to a thread under the semantics of [MSC4306](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4306).
> * Work happened in designing and implementing these MSC both in Synapse and Ruma.
> 
> #### Latest Event
> 
> The Latest Event API is almost done! The new API is ready, … and working! The merging of the last PR is blocked by another project (direct re-decryption in the Event Cache).
> 
> * [#5482](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5482) and [#5556](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5556) The Latest Event is also computed based on the Send Queue, which allows to get local event directly in the room list!
> * [#5561](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5561) Revisit the definition of a `LatestEventValue` so that it can be serialised and deserialised.
> * [#5587](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5587) The `LatestEventValue` is persisted in the store!
> 
> And the patches waiting to be merged:
> 
> * [#5617](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5617) A new sorter for the room list which puts the rooms with a local event at the top of the room list.
> * [#5624](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5624) Cleaning and removing the old Latest Event API.
> 
> #### Performance
> 
> The Event Cache is now pretty central to the SDK. We are working on it every day. Sometimes shortcuts are taken, which results in slow performance. Hopefully, all the Matrix Rust SDK benchmarks now run in the CI!
> 
> * [#5443](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5443) All benchmarks run in the CI!
> 
> Here is a couple of remarkable improvements:
> 
> * [#5620](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5620) Read Receipts are processed 2x faster!
> * [#5579](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5579) Throughput of `SqliteEventCacheStore::find_event_relations` has been improved by 300%.
> * [#5411](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5411) Throughput of `SqliteEventCacheStore::load_all_chunks_metadata` has been improved by 1140%…
> * [#5425](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5425) … then by 13'000%.
> 
> #### Event Cache on IndexedDB
> 
> The Event Cache supports the in-memory backend and the SQLite backend. However, lot of efforts are put to support IndexedDB as a new backend. Progresses are impressive.
> 
> * [#5506](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5506) Add support for the cross-process lock.
> * [#5540](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5540) Add everything necessary to store room's events and thread's events.
> * [#5574](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5574) Add support for the media retention policy.
> * [#5603](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5603) Add support to stre media.
> 
> #### Search
> 
> A new crate is born: `matrix-sdk-search`! It's designed to implement a search engine inside the Matrix Rust SDK, based on the Event Cache. Soon, we will be able to search for any kind of events!
> 
> * The list of patches are a bit long, so [here is the full list](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pulls?q=is%3Apr%20is%3Aclosed%20search%20author%3Adragonfly1033%20updated%3A%3E2025-08-01%20updated%3A%3C2025-09-05) so far.
> 
> #### Encrypted state events
> 
> The [MSC3414](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/blob/travis/msc/encrypted-state/proposals/3414-encrypted-state.md) define how we can encrypt state-events. The implementation has started and is making great progress!

[HarHarLinks](https://matrix.to/#/@kim:sosnowkadub.de) says

> Hello from the [Events Working Group](@/foundation/working-groups/index.md)!
> It's been a couple weeks since our last update, but we have been busy [accepting all your talks](https://cfp.2025.matrix.org/matrix-conf-2025/featured/), planning the [exhibition area](https://conference.matrix.org/sponsor/), coordinating with the venue and [c3voc](https://c3voc.de/)(!) who we are excited will lead the video streaming effort this year, organising food and drink, handing out [ticket vouchers](https://conference.matrix.org/register/#tickets) to Foundation [members](@/support.md) and [Conference sponsors](https://conference.matrix.org/sponsor/), ensuring [health and safety](https://conference.matrix.org/attend/#health-safety-and-accessibility), onboarding [volunteers](https://conference.matrix.org/volunteer/), and planning the schedule.... more about that soon!
> 
> The big Matrix Conference blog post that goes into detail about *everything* is still in the oven, right next to the schedule, but in the meantime we couldn't wait any longer to tell you, so here is a tiny teaser!
> 
> * [Tickets](https://conference.matrix.org/register/#tickets) are available! We have upgraded to a bigger venue, but make sure to get yours before we sell out like last year! 😅🎟️
> * We thank all Conference [sponsors](https://conference.matrix.org/sponsor/) making the Conference financially possible! 💰
> * We also thank everyone who signed up to [volunteer](https://conference.matrix.org/volunteer/) which will make the Conference possible to realise! If you are interested in announcing speakers and their talks on stage and stream, welcoming and scanning attendees' tickets, spread happiness by handing out the Conference merch, or want to try operating a c3voc camera, sign up now via <https://conference.matrix.org/volunteer/> or [#events-wg:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#events-wg:matrix.org)! 📹 PS: It's not quite ready but we already can't wait to share the look of the exclusive zipped hoodie with which we will equip the Conference crew! 👀
> * The Conference will happen at Kaleidos.coop in Strasbourg! We updated the website so it's now easier to find out [where it is and how to get there](https://conference.matrix.org/attend/#getting-there)! 🗺️

> 
> Speaking of the schedule, we have started to share some highlights on social media!
> 
> * Tech doesn't exist in the void. We create products to serve people. But how do people feel about tech? Tenure-track Assistant Pr Carla Griggio studied [how people feel about untraceability](https://bsky.app/profile/matrix.org/post/3lwtn4vs2vl2p), and whether experts make a good job at explaining what it means.
> * Ever wondered why Matrix doesn't use MLS (yet)? Nico will explore how MLS and Matrix work internally, and shed some light on it in the talk "[Matrix and MLS - Water, Oil and Mayonnaise](https://bsky.app/profile/matrix.org/post/3lxu6p7cxql2u)"!
> * bnjbvr is an active member of the Rewrite in Rust task force 🦀, and he wants you to know how you can make your Matrix app go voom in the talk "[Speedrunning Matrix clients with the Rust SDK](https://bsky.app/profile/matrix.org/post/3lxze46yitz2c)"!
