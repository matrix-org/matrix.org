## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Telodendria ([website](https://telodendria.io))

An open source Matrix homeserver implementation written from scratch in ANSI C and designed to be lightweight and simple, yet functional

[Jordan Bancino](https://matrix.to/#/@jordan:synapse.telodendria.org) reports

> Telodendria has migrated all of its online infrastructure from the `telodendria.io` domain to `telodendria.org`. The new canonical address of our official Matrix room is [#general:synapse.telodendria.org](https://matrix.to/#/#general:synapse.telodendria.org). Please update all links and bookmarks to ensure that they don't break when the old domain expires.
>
> After a long break, development on Telodendria will be resuming shortly. You can read more in the [July 2025 Status Update](https://telodendria.org/blog/status-update-july-2025) blog post.

## Dept of Clients 📱

### Neochat ([website](https://invent.kde.org/network/neochat))

A client for matrix, the decentralized communication protocol

[Tobias Fella](https://matrix.to/#/@tobiasfella:kde.org) says

### Fractal ([website](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/fractal))

Matrix messaging app for GNOME written in Rust.

[Kévin Commaille](https://matrix.to/#/@zecakeh:tedomum.net) says

> Want to get a head start and try out Fractal 12 before its release? That’s what this Release Candidate is for! New since 12.beta:
>
> * The upcoming room version 12 is supported, with the special power level of room creators
> * Requesting invites to rooms (aka knocking) is now possible
> * Clicking on the name of the sender of a message adds a mention to them in the composer
>
> As usual, this release includes other improvements, fixes and new translations thanks to all our contributors, and our upstream projects.
>
> It is available to install via Flathub Beta, see the [instructions in our README](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/fractal#installation-instructions).
>
> As the version implies, it should be mostly stable and we expect to only include minor improvements until the release of Fractal 12.
>
> If you want to join the fun, you can try to fix one of our [newcomers issues](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/fractal/-/issues/?label_name%5B%5D=4.%20Newcomers). We are always looking for new contributors!

### Element X iOS ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios))

A total rewrite of Element iOS using the Matrix Rust SDK underneath and targeting devices running iOS 16+.

[Mauro Romito](https://matrix.to/#/@mauro.romito:element.io) reports

> * Submitted RC 25.08.0
> * Started working on supporting v12 rooms on EL-X
> * Spaces work is going smoothly, and we are working on supporting the tab bar to switch between all rooms, and spaces
> * Same for threads, which can now be tested experimentally by using developer options
> * When sending videos the app will take in account the max upload size defined by the server when compressing it
> * If any file is bigger than the max upload size, we won't even try to send it and inform the user of the HS limitation

### Element X Android ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-android))

Android Matrix messenger application using the Matrix Rust SDK and Jetpack Compose.

[ganfra](https://matrix.to/#/@ganfra:matrix.org) says

> * Support for 16KB page size

## Dept of Non Chat Clients 🎛️

### Matrix Wrench ([website](https://gitlab.com/jaller94/matrix-wrench/))

Matrix Wrench is a web client to tweak Matrix rooms.

[jaller94](https://matrix.to/#/@jaller94:matrix.org) announces

> Since yesterday, I've started updating Matrix Wrench – the webapp to inspect and tweak Matrix rooms and their state events.
>
> You can expect a few updates coming this weekend to support room version "12" and offer fine-grained, client-side room upgrades.

## Dept of VoIP 🤙

### Element Call ([website](https://call.element.io))

Native Decentralised End-to-end Encrypted Group Calls in Matrix.

[Robin](https://matrix.to/#/@robin:robin.town) reports

> 🚀 We’ve just released **v0.14.0** with a mix of new features, improvements, and fixes! Notification stability is soon to be improved by moving the call notification handling into the EC app (instead of relying on EX and Element Web clients). Calls should now feel smoother with fewer cases of participants disappearing and reappearing, thanks to adjusted timeouts and sending multiple restarts for delayed events simultaneously. We’ve also polished the earpiece overlay with clearer text and better visibility, touched up error screens, and fixed an iOS Bluetooth issue where audio could unexpectedly switch from Bluetooth to speaker. 🔗 [Full changelog](https://github.com/element-hq/element-call/releases/tag/v0.14.0)

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰

### Rory&::LibMatrix ([website](https://cgit.rory.gay/matrix/LibMatrix.git/))

.NET 9 matrix bot/client library/SDK

[Emma [it/its]](https://matrix.to/#/@emma:rory.gay) says

> Hi! It's been about a month since the last news update!
>
> What's new/changed?
>
> * Client
>   * Added support for room version 12, and it's various changes
>   * In addition to that, various utility methods have been added to help replace common patterns, such as offering a function to get relevant servers from "Room creators" in the room creation event rather than relying on parsing the room ID...
>   * Fixed fetching events with MSC2815 (including redacted content) so it works on not my patched version of synapse (oops)
>   * Properly support reading server capabilities
>   * Expose server ACL events as regexes to allow more consistent matching across tooling
>   * Added explicit support for sending events in bulk, though the behavior side of this is not yet finalized. This also supports [my synapse patch](https://cgit.rory.gay/matrix/thirdparty/synapse.git/commit/?h=emma/patches&id=452f38800dd00b8686543099d6a085f9b4210687) to add server-sided support for this.
>   * Fixed error and ratelimit handling somewhat
>     * Rate limits no longer depend on `retry_after_ms` in the response body
>     * Bad gateway errors will be automatically retried every 1-2 seconds until successful.
>   * Added a lot more dials to the room builder, as well as some work on supporting room upgrades by extension.
> * Federation
>   * Cleaned up some of the federation related code with more abstractions
>   * Proper federation authentication support has been added
> * Developer/user experience
>   * Added more debugger displays to summarize simple objects (such as event lists)
>   * Added support for streaming and fixed some handling of JSON data - this should reduce CPU spikes where possible
>
> ***And, as always:***
>
> * The code is available at [cgit.rory.gay](https://cgit.rory.gay/matrix/LibMatrix.git) (or [Github - read only, may be outdated](https://github.com/Rory-LibMatrix/LibMatrix.git))!
>   * All contributions are more than welcome, be it documentation, code, anything! Perhaps, example usecases, bots, ...?
> * Discussion, suggestions and ideas are welcome in [#libmatrix:rory.gay](https://matrix.to/#/#libmatrix:rory.gay) (Space: [#mru-space:rory.gay](https://matrix.to/#/#mru-space:rory.gay))
> * Got a cool project that you're working on and want to share, using LibMatrix? Be sure to let us know, we'd love to hear all about it!

### matrix-rust-sdk ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk))

Your all-in-one toolkit for creating Matrix clients with Rust, from simple bots to full-featured apps, with bindings to Swift, Kotlin, WebAssembly, Go and more

[poljar](https://matrix.to/#/@poljar:matrix.org) says

> The summer holidays continue and things are relatively calm. Still, progress hasn’t stopped. Here’s a summary of notable developments in the Matrix Rust SDK over the past week:
>
> * The send queue can now report the current progress for media being uploaded, thanks to Johannes Marbach ([#5453](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5453), [#5469](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5469)). Integration in the timeline should come Soon™.
> * Experiments with MSC4306 (threads subscriptions) are moving forward, with the SDK now able to [(un)subscribe to individual threads](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5439), locally [remember thread subscriptions](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5455), and experimental PRs are up for [automatically subscribing to threads](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5462). Exciting!
> * Timeline items that were previously marked as UTD (Unable To Decrypt) but resolve into unsupported event types are now properly removed ([#5463](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5463)).
> * Benchmarking is now enabled in continuous integration to help track performance trends over time ([#5443](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5443)).
> * A draft pull request introduces early experimental support for encrypted state events ([#5456](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5456)).

## Dept of Events and Talks 🗣️

### Matrix Community Summit 2025 ([website](https://matrix-community.events/conferences/2025-summit.html))

[Yan](https://matrix.to/#/@yan:datanauten.de) announces

> **Patchlevel: Real-Time Hacktogetherness in Berlin**
> 
> Broadcasting live from the legendary c-base in Berlin, the [Matrix Community Summit](https://matrix-community.events/) is in full swing: Four days of hacking, debugging, and spontaneous brainclustering—powered by over two dozen developers, bridge wranglers, and federation fanatics from across the Matrixverse.
>
> The first two days were all about unstructured breakfast-hackflowing: all-day Brezn™, low-latency topic switching, and end-to-end discussions stretching deep into the night. All the while, chilled Liquid Drum’n’Bass gently massages the packets through the air—because nothing complements federation like a good sub-bass handshake.
>
> As of now, the collective co-presence has shapeshifted into a semi-structured ad-hocracy: thanks to [OpenKi](https://openki.matrix-community.events/join/AHKsRCMDw7myT3l8QP2MbYJZc3Bvyi6MpaHFC6ap1aT?tenant=hpwfx5oToabMJavRK), sessions are collaboratively summoned into existence via dynamic interest-expression-clicky-buttons (™ pending). Time, space, and participation auto-adjust, like a well-federated room on low power mode.
>
> Whether it’s Federation Bottleneck Debugging, Bridge UX Flowchartathons, or Clickpath Optimisation Roundtables—if it fits into the Matrix mental model, it finds a home here.
>
> And yes, in true cyberpunk fashion, this announcement was semi-synthetically co-authored with ChatGPT. Curious how it came about? [Explore the full conversation here](https://chatgpt.com/share/688cdb22-7ea8-8007-9f90-c01e2c106a73).
>
> If you're in Berlin and believe communication freedom shouldn't be throttled by platform borders—[come by](https://matrix.to/#/#mcs25-general:datanauten.de), plug in, and federate your mind.
