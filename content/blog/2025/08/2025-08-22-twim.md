## Dept of Trust & Safety ⚖️

[Sky](https://matrix.to/#/@sky:codestorm.net) announces

> Today, Cat and Sky want to formally launch Muninn Hall.
>
> Muninn Hall is a new community for public Matrix homeserver staff, from administrators to custodial and janitorial moderators.
> We want to provide a space to pool knowledge, collaborate, and support each other in the efforts of running publix Matrix homeservers. This can range from Trust & Safety, systems administration, or general community management.
>
> Why Muninn Hall?
> While there are various Matrix rooms that may look similar to what we aim to do, we couldnt find anything with a comparable concept yet.
>
> The plan is to:
>
> * meet in the Matrix space for easy exchange and coordination between each other
> * have the main Muninn Hall [website](https://muninn-hall.com/) where we want to pool all kinds of relevant documentation regarding public Matrix homeservers
> * publish blogs like [Introducing Muninn Hall](https://muninn-hall.com/blog/2025-08-19/introducing-muninn-hall), or maybe a homeserver admin sharing their experiences with $topic
>
> How to Join
>
> A senior staff member joins [#muninn-hall-screening:feline.support](https://matrix.to/#/#muninn-hall-screening:feline.support) (<https://matrix.to/#/!6E8eJaLZRz_w-LhzxEHRXc_fUowMu8JZk7RAGLdc0Bk>), the welcome bot will explain what to do.
> Once cleared, other staff from the same homeserver can join.
> The easiest path is being listed in your homeserver’s [MSC1929](https://spec.matrix.org/v1.12/client-server-api/#getwell-knownmatrixsupport) support record.
>
> Who Qualifies?
>
> * Admins and staff of public homeservers.

## Dept of Clients 📱

### gomuks web ([website](https://github.com/gomuks/gomuks))

A Matrix client written in Go

[tulir](https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net) reports

> The gomuks backend now supports being compiled to wasm to run the web client fully in-browser. You can find a demo at <https://demo.gomuks.app>
>
> The performance is worse than natively due to OPFS being slow, but it works reasonably well with small accounts ([OPFS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File\_System\_API/Origin\_private\_file\_system) is the web storage API that the official wasm build of SQLite uses). The database code is quite hacky even if you ignore the OPFS performance issues: there's no way to use cgo in wasm, so I wrote my own Go database connector which calls the SQLite C API via JS: <https://github.com/gomuks/gomuks/tree/main/pkg/sqlite-wasm-js>. The hacky storage and other wasm-specific weirdness means it's somewhat fragile and will explode if you hold it wrong.

### Element X iOS ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios))

A total rewrite of Element iOS using the Matrix Rust SDK underneath and targeting devices running iOS 16+.

[Doug](https://matrix.to/#/@douge:matrix.org) says

> * We released 25.08.5 to the App Store on Monday which fixed a bug that could sometimes occur when following tombstone links for v12 rooms.
> * The initial flows for exploring your spaces are coming on nicely, including navigation using the split view when running on iPad.
> * We’re working on our own solution for converting HTML into AttributedStrings (based on [SwiftSoup](https://github.com/scinfu/SwiftSoup)) to replace our current implementation (which uses DTCoreText and post-processes the result) so that we have complete control over the final output.

### mrvc, max room version checker ([website](https://codeberg.org/june64/mrvc))

[June](https://matrix.to/#/@june:nekover.se) announces

> Announcing mrvc (max room version checker)
>
> mrvc is a small tool for checking how many members of a given Matrix room support which maximum room version.
> The idea has been sparked by the new room version 12 being released, so that one can assess the adoption rate of the new room version and make an educated decision on when to upgrade rooms.
> (Please note that it only checks the homeserver-side, not the client-side, for support.)
>
> Aside from that, it got a bunch of additional features, like:
>
> * Showing member count broken down by homeserver implementation and version.
> * Checking multiple rooms at once.
> * Recursively checking all rooms of a given space.
> * And more!
>
> You can check it out at: <https://codeberg.org/june64/mrvc>

## Dept of Interesting News

### Survey: Cyber Resilience Act and Open Source

[Yan](https://matrix.to/#/@yan:datanauten.de) announces

> The German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) is currently running an online survey on the Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) via its "Dialogue for Cybersecurity".
>
> The aim is to better understand the impact of the CRA on open source and to develop practical guidelines based on community input.
>
> The survey is aimed at three groups:
>
> * Manufacturers
> * Open source projects
> * Potential open source stewards
>
> The survey is anonymous and open until 31 August 2025.
>
> Responses received by 30 July 2025 were included in an initial evaluation [presented](https://programm.froscon.org/froscon2025/talk/0a656836-cb27-4ef1-80e1-d64c553a96ca/) at FrOSCon 2025.

> * [Manufacturers (DE)](https://dialog-cybersicherheit.limesurvey.net/552671?lang=de)
> * [Open source projects (DE)](https://dialog-cybersicherheit.limesurvey.net/323741?lang=de)

> * [Potential open source stewards (EN)](https://dialog-cybersicherheit.limesurvey.net/146965?lang=en)
>
> ### Why this matters for Matrix
>
> The CRA will influence how open source software is developed, distributed, and maintained across Europe.
>
> For the Matrix ecosystem, this includes everything from server implementations (e.g. Synapse, Dendrite), to client apps, to bridges.
>
> By participating in the survey, the Matrix community can ensure its perspective is heard and that resulting guidelines enable sustainable, community-led, open collaboration.
>
> If you maintain, contribute to, or rely on Matrix projects, please consider filling out the survey and share it with others in our community.
