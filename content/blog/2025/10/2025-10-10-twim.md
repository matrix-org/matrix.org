> We are concerned that the Danish Presidency’s current proposal on the Regulation for Child Sexual Abuse could introduce backdoors and client-side scanning, creating risks for security, innovation and digital sovereignty in Europe.
> 
> We urge European leaders to ensure that any approach protects encryption, privacy, and the trust that underpins Europe’s digital ecosystem.

## Dept of Spec 📜

[Andrew Morgan (anoa) {he/him}](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io) reports

> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <https://spec.matrix.org/proposals>.
> 
> 
> ### MSC Status
> 
> **New MSCs:**
> * *There were no new MSCs this week.*
> 
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
> * [MSC4312: Resetting cross-signing keys in the OAuth world](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4312) (merge)
> * [MSC4190: Device management for application services](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4190) (merge)

> The team continues to work on [MSCs related to Matrix 2.0](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pulls?q=is%3Aopen%20is%3Apr%20label%3Amatrix-2.0). While the list still looks long, two MSCs are currently in FCP, with [MSC4153](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4153) having finished it! There's plenty of implementation work happening in the sidelines as well.
> 
> Overall it's really nice to see movement on these proposals - some quite large and complex - after so long.

## Dept of Clients 📱

### Element X iOS ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios))

A total rewrite of Element iOS using the Matrix Rust SDK underneath and targeting devices running iOS 17+.

[Mauro Romito](https://matrix.to/#/@mauro.romito:element.io) reports

> * A new RC has been sent for verification which includes the following features:
>   - Spaces (browse only)
>   - Liquid glass support
>   - The labs section, which will make testing experimental features easier, as of right now the only experimental feature in labs is Threads
> * Spaces and Threads work is still going we are now working on managing and creating new spaces, and improving the current UX for Threads.
> * We started investigating how to automatically perform a verification using existing classic Element data, will probably take a while before a full implementation, but will allow users to automatically verify EX using their existing installation of classic Element.

### Element X Android ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-android))

Android Matrix messenger application using the Matrix Rust SDK and Jetpack Compose.

[Benoit](https://matrix.to/#/@benoit.marty:matrix.org) reports

> * We've just submitted the release 25.10.0 on the PlayStore including a read only access to your Spaces. Note that your account must have joined at least one Space for the new tab with Spaces to be displayed. You can now view your existing Spaces, navigate through the Spaces hierarchy, and leave Spaces. More functionalities will come in the next releases. 
> * The release also includes a new labs section, which will make testing experimental features easier. It has one item as the moment: Threads, which was previously a hidden Feature Flag. When enabled the messages in thread are rendered in a dedicated timeline, as per Element Web and Element Classic.
> * A change in the reaction: your recently used Emojis (across all Element clients and other Matrix clients that support this feature) are now displayed when you long click on a message (you can scroll the row of Emojis) and in a new tab in the screen displayed when you click on "other Emoji".
> * Notifications have been updated, to play the sound than Element Web and Element X iOS.
> * Besides that, a lot of dependency updates, bug fixes and improvements, in order to always offer the best user experience!
> * Final note: we are seeing very interesting pull requests coming from the community: one is about being able to render a video playback while double tasking (<https://github.com/element-hq/element-x-android/pull/5423>), and another about being able to change the playback speed of voice messages (<https://github.com/element-hq/element-x-android/pull/5504>). They are both in review. Thanks for the contributions!

### Matrix Community Summit 2026 hosted at c-base, Berlin

[Yan](https://matrix.to/#/@yan:datanauten.de) reports

> Last week, the circle of c-base decided to host the Matrix Community Summit 2026 for the Matrix community. If your organization, university, group, or network wants to participate, organize, join, or help shape the event, now is the moment to jump in.
> 
> We tested a concept in 2025 combining coworking, hands-on sessions, daytime bug hunts, brainstorming, philosophical discussion, DJ sets, and social experiments conducted in a federated, side-by-side model. In 2026, we want to expand that: more collaboration, more variety, more voices.
> 
> Join us in the Matrix room <https://matrix.to/#/#mcs26-orga:datanauten.de> to connect, propose, or volunteer. A barcamp session at the Matrix Conference in Strasbourg will also help align ideas.
> 
> Save the date: 22–25 May 2026 (Pentecost weekend). We’ve made arrangements with c-base for the coming years so that future Summits can reliably fall on every Pentecost weekend in Berlin.
> 
> Please help spread this announcement and invite people who care about Matrix.
