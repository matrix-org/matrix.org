### DINUM sponsors Matrix

[Amandine](https://matrix.to/#/@Amandine:matrix.org) says

> üá´üá∑ Very excited to announce that [DINUM, the French Interministerial Digital Directorate, is joining The Matrix.org Foundation](https://www.numerique.gouv.fr/sinformer/espace-presse/dinum-soutien-fondation-matrixorg/) as a Silver member and becomes the first government to join the Foundation! üöÄ
>
> Matrix is the backbone of [Tchap](https://tchap.numerique.gouv.fr/), the secure messaging app for the French government, and it is great to see a State stepping up to concretely support and collaborate with an open source project so critical to their functioning.
>
> üí° We hope this will show the way to all the other public sector organisations using Matrix, especially after we kicked off a Matrix for Public Sector group at the Matrix Conference last week, hopefully soon approved by the Governing Board as an official [Working Group](https://matrix.org/foundation/working-groups/) ü§û!

### Matrix.org Foundation to receive funding from FLOSS/fund

> We are excited this week that The Matrix.org Foundation is to [receive $25000 in funding](https://floss.fund/blog/second-tranche-2025-anniversary/) from [FLOSS/fund](https://floss.fund)!
>
> Quoting from their website,
> > Started in 2024 at [Zerodha](https://zerodha.com/open-source), FLOSS/fund is dedicated to supporting critical, impactful, and valuable Free/Libre and Open Source projects globally.
>
> Earlier this year, some Matrix nerds from [#community-events:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#community-events:matrix.org) visited the [FOSSASIA](https://fossasia.org/) summit in Bangkok, Thailand, (watch this space for 2026! üëÄ) where we met the super enthusiastic folks from FLOSS/fund who urged us to join as they are very excited about Matrix and see it as important FLOSS infrastructure; both directly by itself, and also due to being supporting infrastructure used to make significant amounts of FLOSS projects happen.
>
> As we returned home and after getting approval from the Foundation, the [Website & Content Working Group](https://matrix.org/foundation/working-groups/) got to work and [published](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/pull/2660) the `funding.json` and related files to the website as well as some important projects of the Foundation, such that they would become indexed and available to easily browse at <https://dir.floss.fund/view/projects/@matrix.org>. This is a very interesting project in itself! It is really well implemented and in our eyes the setup matches the open source spirit perfectly.
>
> And just last weekend, as we are wrapping up [The Matrix Conference](https://conference.matrix.org) in Strasbourg, we receive word that Matrix has been [selected in the second tranche of 2025 to receive $25000](https://floss.fund/blog/second-tranche-2025-anniversary/)!
>
> We congratulate all of the other awesome projects who were selected! üéâ  
> A million thanks to FLOSS/fund for selecting us, as well as everyone else involved for making this happen. ü§©  
> We are excited to see where the road for FLOSS/fund leads next year! üöÄ  
> If you are able and looking to fund FLOSS projects you are building on, find worth supporting, or even just to discover new ones, we absolutely encourage you to browse the awesome directory at <https://dir.floss.fund/>!
>
> Find out how else you can support The Matrix.org Foundation at <https://matrix.org/support/>. Does your organisation rely on Matrix? [Join us as a funding member](https://matrix.org/membership/).

### Updated Support and Membership Pages

[HarHarLinks](https://matrix.to/#/@kim:sosnowkadub.de) reports

> Just in time for The Matrix Conference, the Website & Content WG have revamped the /support and /membership pages of matrix.org for clearer structure, making it easier to find the methods to support the Foundation, and collecting all info about membership on one page instead of spreading it across multiple.
>
> Check it out on <https://matrix.org/support/>, from where you can also navigate to learn more about <https://matrix.org/membership/>.
>
> Please let us know your thoughts, and if there is anything else to add, at #matrix.org-website:matrix.org!

### MSC Crafter

> Working on a new small project to render MSCs in a faster, learner format than GitHub currently allows with intelligent rendering of things like:
>
> - Comment theads
> - Ticky boxes for FCP
> - MSC state based on labels
> - Linking together mentioned MSCs and spec items to easily lay out how a spec maps to Matrix
>
> As well as that, primarily I want to add offline support to all of this so I can use it as a quick reference too when working on Matrix.
>
> It's already slightly functional: <https://github.com/Half-Shot/msc-crafter>

>
> **Accepted MSCs:**
>
> - *No MSCs were accepted this week.*
>
> **Closed MSCs:**
>
> - *No MSCs were closed/rejected this week.*
>
> ### Spec Updates
>
> The barrage of MSCs marked as FCP close above are the result of the next-gen auth being merged to the spec, and the Spec Core Team going through and closing all the MSCs that it obsoletes.
>
> Otherwise, with the Matrix conference last weekend behind us, the SCT are continuing to focus on Matrix 2.0 MSCs with a more relaxed cadence.

### Synapse ([website](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/))

Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by Element.

[Andrew Morgan (anoa) {he/him}](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io) reports

> #### Deprecation of MacOS Python wheels
>
> The team has decided to deprecate and eventually stop publishing python wheels of Synapse for MacOS. This is a burden on the team, and we're not aware of any parties that use them. Synapse docker images will continue to work on MacOS, as will building Synapse from source (though note this requires a Rust compiler).
>
> Publishing MacOS Python wheels will continue for the next few releases. If you do make use of these wheels downstream, please reach out to us in [#synapse-dev:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#synapse-dev:matrix.org). We'd love to hear from you!

### Fractal ([website](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/fractal))

Matrix messaging app for GNOME written in Rust.

[K√©vin Commaille](https://matrix.to/#/@zecakeh:tedomum.net) reports

> Ah, Autumn‚Ä¶ The trees are wearing their warmest colors, the wine harvest is ending, developers are preparing to hibernate‚Ä¶ and Fractal 13.rc is here!
>
> Our repository has been relatively quiet since the beta release, with mostly work on bug fixes for our new audio player, and a bit of code refactoring.
>
> As usual, this release includes other improvements, fixes and new translations thanks to all our contributors, and our upstream projects.
>
> It is available to install via Flathub Beta, see the [instructions in our README](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/fractal#installation-instructions).
>
> As the version implies, it should be mostly stable and we expect to only include minor improvements until the release of Fractal 13.
>
> If you want to join the fun, you can try to fix one of our [newcomers issues](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/fractal/-/issues/?label_name%5B%5D=4.%20Newcomers). We are always looking for new contributors!

### Element X iOS ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios))

A total rewrite of Element iOS using the Matrix Rust SDK underneath and targeting devices running iOS 17+.

[Mauro Romito](https://matrix.to/#/@mauro.romito:element.io) reports

> - More features are coming to Spaces, like a way to check their members and invite new ones
> - Various fixes for iOS 26, one in particular fixes the scrolling behaviour not working properly sometime in the timeline.
> - Notifications are also getting improved so that they may bring you directly to a Thread if the lab feature is enabled

[Mauro Romito](https://matrix.to/#/@mauro.romito:element.io) reports

> - New RC has been sent for verification, it includes mostly fixes and stability improvements for iOS 26.
> - We are also working on having push notifications focus directly the events they are representing once you tap them.
> - Spaces work is progressing, we are implementing a way to view members of a space and manage their settings, while also taking the time to refactor and improve our codebase so that the flows that are common between rooms and spaces can be reused.

### Element X Android ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-android))

Android Matrix messenger application using the Matrix Rust SDK and Jetpack Compose.

[Jorge](https://matrix.to/#/@jorgem:element.io) announces

> The team has been working hard on improving spaces and threads:
>
> - üì≥ We want you to be able to have separate notification groups for threads in rooms, and these should take you to the thread when opened.
> - üè† We're improving the architecture of the app to improve how spaces integrate with it, and also improving the design.
> - üîÑ There is a new feature flag enabled by default in nightly builds to use [WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/develop/background-work/background-tasks/persistent) to fetch the notification content for push notifications. We had to implement this since there are some restrictions on Android 15 and higher that won't allow the app to make network requests when it's on background, even after receiving a push notification. This should now be fixed, but since it's a new implementation there might be some regressions. Please try it out and let us know!
> - üèéÔ∏è There is some planned work for improving the overall performance of the Element X Android application, focused on the bottleneck caused by fetching data from the Rust SDK and other rough edges. If all goes well, expect to see performance improvements soon!

### Element ([website](https://element.io))

Everything related to Element but not strictly bound to a client.

[Matthew](https://matrix.to/#/@matthew:matrix.org) reports

> Element finally got around to renaming its legal entity from New Vector Ltd to Element Creations Ltd, as fun as it was having the company misnamed under the 2015 vintage brandname of Vector. This is purely cosmetic and has no impact on anything other the name used on appstore accounts (once updated), copyright statements and legal docs.

### synadm ([website](https://codeberg.org/synadm/synadm))

Command line admin tool for Synapse (Matrix homeserver).

[jacksonchen666 (they/it)](https://matrix.to/#/@jacksonchen666:jacksonchen666.com) says

> Here's the summarized release notes for [v0.49](https://codeberg.org/synadm/synadm/releases/tag/v0.49):
>
> - Unix socket support!
> - synadm now sends a user-agent of its own now, including the version in the user-agent
> - `synadm media purge --before-days 0` now works (deletes all remote media before now). This also applies to local media deletion which has the same arguments.
> - Speaking of local media deletion, local media deletion now prompts for confirmation.
> - synadm correctly honors the "Verify certificates" setting (self-signed TLS/SSL certs should work now)
> - Forgot to include this in release notes, but there's also now a detailed [Getting Started](https://synadm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html) guide on the documentation. It will eventually replace the instructions in the README, but I am just getting started on the documentation (heh).
>
> The additional 2 hotfix patch releases ([v0.49.1](https://codeberg.org/synadm/synadm/releases/tag/v0.49.1) and [v0.49.2](https://codeberg.org/synadm/synadm/releases/tag/v0.49.2)) really are just bug fixes for new things in v0.49. The latest is now v0.49.2.
>
> Oh, and [#synadm:peek-a-boo.at](https://matrix.to/#/#synadm:peek-a-boo.at) is our matrix room, and [the Code is on the berg](https://codeberg.org/synadm/synadm) (uh, Codeberg). That's all!

### Synapse Admin Updates

The last TWIM entry about [etke.cc's Synapse Admin fork](https://github.com/etkecc/synapse-admin) was *very* long ago - we stopped publishing them because the big / major changes were already implemented, and while each new release increased QoL and UX, there were not so much TWIM-worthy things.

But today we have a big thing to announce:

**OIDC Auth support has been implemented** by @beastafk:etke.cc

It was requested [in the upstream project in 2023](https://github.com/Awesome-Technologies/synapse-admin/issues/429), and finally [implemented in etke.cc's Synapse Admin fork](https://github.com/etkecc/synapse-admin), making it more convenient for servers deployed with MAS.

Apart from that, there were a lot of smaller-yet-convenient changes:

- New localizations: Japanese (thanks to @shirahara:etke.cc ) and Ukrainian (thanks to [khvalera](https://github.com/khvalera))
- External Auth Provider-compatible mode (less painful for OIDC, LDAP, etc.)
- Ongoing mobile UI improvements
- Support 3pids in bulk registration (csv import)
- Improved user account status toggles
- And many more small improvements here and there

And for [etke.cc](https://etke.cc/) customers specifically, [more exclusive features](https://github.com/etkecc/synapse-admin/tree/main/src/components/etke.cc#etkecc-specific-components) have been added

[Source code](https://github.com/etkecc/synapse-admin), [admin.etke.cc (CDN version)](https://admin.etke.cc), and don't forget to say hi in the #synapse-admin:etke.cc room!
