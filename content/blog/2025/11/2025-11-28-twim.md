### Synapse ([website](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/))

Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by Element.

[Devon Dmytro](https://matrix.to/#/@devonh:one.ems.host) says

> This week we released Synapse v1.143.0.
> 
> Of note for this release:
> - support for PostgreSQL 13 has been removed as per our [deprecation policy](https://element-hq.github.io/synapse/latest/deprecation_policy.html#platform-dependencies). Synapse will fail to start when run with PostgreSQL 13.
> - this will be the last release to support macOS wheels. We haven't heard any feedback from anyone still using these so we will go ahead with the plan and discontinue their generation.
> 
> Thank you to all our contributors for helping to make Synapse the best it can be.
> As always, feel free to stop by [#synapse:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#synapse:matrix.org) to join in on the discussion and if you encounter a bug make sure to report it [here](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/issues/new/choose).

[Ivan 🦀](https://matrix.to/#/@mnt_io:matrix.org) reports

> What nice improvements have been made these past 2 weeks! Can't wait to share them with you!
> 
> #### Redecryptor
> 
> A new API, a new pun. Let's welcome R2D2, the new `Redecryptor` API that has recently land in the Event Cache. With this new API, the Event Cache is responsible to redecrypt events that failed to be decrypted at the first try (because keys may be lagging or _insert non-sense reasons inherent to decentralized end-to-end encryption_).
> 
> - [#5746](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5746) The `Redecryptor` has fully landed!
> - [#5868](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5869) To remove the old redecryption logic from the Timeline.
> - [#5881](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5881) To fix a race condition in the redecryptor leading to missed decryption attempts (known bug, see [#5474](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues/5474)).
> - [#3872](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues/3872) is finally closed!
> 
> Not only it's cleaner, it's also more efficient and it handles more complex situations. Kudos!
> 
> #### Latest Event
> 
> The new Latest Event API is finally used more widely. The Element X clients are using it, and it rocks. The clients feel more reactive and snappy. It is even possible to see a little 🕙 in the room list for messages being sent. It means that your local messages are now displayed in the Room List!
> 
> With this new feature comes news bugs. Of course. People can't just use something without breaking it. Otherwise, where would be the fun, I'm asking you!
> 
> - [#5908](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5908) When a message cannot be sent (because your subway is upset with the mobile network), it's marked as “cannot be sent”, and so any other new messages should be marked as “cannot be sent” too automatically.
> - [#5885](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5885) The user profile details are now attached to the `LatestEventValue` automatically, so that the client can do richer rendering in the Room List.
> - [#5913](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5913) —not merged yet— The `LatestEventValue` reflects edits too. These aggregated events are a bit complex to handle, but we gently start to have a nice toolset to handle these cases now, yepee.
> 
> #### Sliding Sync
> 
> We constantly improve sliding sync, both client and server side, with performance improvements in mind.
> 
> - [#5878](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5878) We've changed how `SlidingSync` client enters the long-polling mode. Now, `SlidingSyncListBuilder` provides a new `requires_timeout` method, which takes a user-defined function, used to decide whether a request should do a long-polling or not. With this new feature, we have more controls to recover from complex scenarios (network is always complex), and thus improving the user experience. The previous behaviour is kept by default for the sake of consistency.
> 
> We are about to revisit the `matrix_sdk::room_list_service::SyncIndicator` behaviour too. Expect news on that front soon.
> 
> #### Event Cache store is cross-process lock aware
> 
> We said last time we've improved the `CrossProcessLock` so that a process knows when another process obtained a lock while the former got suspended. This information is required so that a process can decide to refresh its in-memory state when this happens. The Media store was already cross-process lock aware. Now there is a new name in the list.
> 
> - [#5856](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5856) The Event Cache store is now also cross-process lock aware. Every time an API is called in `EventCache` or `RoomEventCache`, a new read- or write-lock is obtained, and the in-memory state is automatically refreshed if required. Kudos to the reviewers, that wasn't a small set of patches!
> 
> This contribution frees the road for the _Badge Counter_ project, but also for the _Events from notification are stored in the main app_ project. It's exciting!
> 
> This work was also required to continue working on Threads, where we want to persist thread events. This work has started.
> 
> #### Misc
> 
> - [#5856](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5856) It adds support for `*aarch64-apple-watchos` target triples, i.e. we can build the Matrix Rust SDK for watchOS!
> - [#5879](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5879) We have an AI policy now!
> - [#5898](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5898) We expose session expiration errors during QR login.

### Matrix Connectivity Tester

[MTRNord (they/them)](https://matrix.to/#/@mtrnord:mtrnord.blog) announces

> It's been a while since my last update, but a few things happened.
> 
> First of all there is an ongoing rewrite happening for the frontend. The key points with that are that it switches to the rebranded ukgov theme (which will at some point also get a custom colour scheme to avoid confusion), it uses SSR instead of full client-side rendering, and it has a revamped structure around its results. One major change in that being the arrival of finally showing suggestions on how to actually resolve your issues.
> You can find that deployed at <https://beta.connectivity-tester.mtrnord.blog/>
> 
> Note however that this is still relatively early in the process, so only the start page and the results page are available at this time. Additionally, I am far from handling all the various ways federation can fail and writing suggestions on how to fix those. This is going to take some more time to figure out and improve, and most important, to make it technically correct in all cases.
> Additionally, the source code is not yet available since it is very fast moving still, however expect it to be published under the same license as the existing UI (AGPL-3.0). I am hoping to make this happen within the next weeks.
> 
> Beyond the rewrite of the UI, there is also some change to ways to access the source code and how to reach out. The source code is now also available at <https://git.midnightthoughts.space/rust-federation-tester/> and <https://git.midnightthoughts.space/matrix-connection-tester-ui/> instead of just GitHub. With that, I also provide a mailing list (yes, those still exist) at <https://lists.midnightthoughts.space/mailman3/lists/matrix-connectivity-tester.lists.midnightthoughts.space/> for people who prefer not to use GitHub to contribute or for people to ask questions. If providing patches using the mailing list, please use the format you would get using git send-mail or git format-patch. GitHub Contributions of course are also still accepted.
> 
> As usual, you can find the production deployment at <https://federationtester.mtrnord.blog/> for use at your convenience :)
