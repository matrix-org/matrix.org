## Dept of Working Groups 💪

[Sky](https://matrix.to/#/@sky:codestorm.net) reports

> Cutting the ribbon on the reopened matrix.org room directory!
> 
> Back in early September, the [room directory working group](@/foundation/working-groups/index.md) started an initial [beta test run](@/blog/2025/09/2025-09-12-twim.md#dept-of-trust-safety-scales). For the first time in months, it was possible again to get new rooms into the directory.
> 
> Since then, we’ve reworked the multiple forms into one universal one to make things easier for users. We also identified several pain points in the process and validated that our imagined workflow actually works in practice.
> There are still improvements we’re actively working on, but we’re already happy with the current stage.
> 
> There is now a dedicated subpage for the room directory on the matrix.org homepage [—you can find it here—](@/homeserver/room_directory.md) where users can easily access all relevant info. Please share it around!
> 
> If you’d like to give feedback or get involved, feel free to walk by in our [#room-dir-wg-office:neko.dev](https://matrix.to/#/#room-dir-wg-office:neko.dev).

## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Synapse ([website](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/))

Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by Element.

[Devon Dmytro](https://matrix.to/#/@devonh:one.ems.host) announces

> This week we released Synapse v1.142.0.
> 
> This release has a few notable changes for server admins to be aware of:
> * Support for Python 3.9 has been dropped as it is now [end of life](https://endoflife.date/python)
> * The minimum supported version of SQLite has been increased to 3.40.0
> * The MacOS Python Wheels are being deprecated and will stop being published as of Synapse 1.144.0. We would love to hear from you if you make use of these.
> 
> ⚠️ We have just been made aware of a regression in Synapse's MAS integration affecting support for MAS instances hosted under a subpath.
> See [this issue](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/issues/19184) for further details.
> We are working on a fix and hope to have a patch out shortly.
> 
> Thank you to all our contributors for helping to make Synapse the best it can be.
> As always, feel free to stop by [#synapse:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#synapse:matrix.org) to join in on the discussion and if you encounter a bug make sure to report it [here](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/issues/new/choose).

## Dept of Clients 📱

### Element Web/Desktop ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-web))

Secure and independent communication, connected via Matrix. Come talk with us in [#element-web:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#element-web:matrix.org)!

[David Langley](https://matrix.to/#/@langleyd:matrix.org) says

> 🌍 Hello from the Element Web Team
> 
> #### 👬 Future Room List Updates
> 
> Thanks to all who provided feedback on the first version of the new left panel and room list we released in September 2025. We have gathered and considered the feedback and used it to shape the future iterations.
> 
> For a visual of where we are headed and further details of what changes we will be making next please check out [this issue](https://github.com/element-hq/element-web/issues/31207).
> 
> TL;DR, we are going to:
> 
> * Reintroduce the "People" meta space
> * Add a quick setting for message previews
> * Add Room List "Sections" and/or "Personal Groups" (v1)
> * Update the sorting mechanisms to prioritise/stick unreads at the top

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰

### Rory&::LibMatrix ([website](https://cgit.rory.gay/matrix/LibMatrix.git/))

.NET 10 Matrix bot/client library/SDK.

[Emma [it/its]](https://matrix.to/#/@emma:rory.gay) reports

> *<u>Your</u> friendly .NET 10 Matrix SDK*
> 
> Good $DATE $TIME everyone! I wanted to give an update on the state of the Rory&::LibMatrix family of projects!
> 
> #### What's new:
> * We've been working on proper publishing on NuGet, while unfinished, you should start seeing build artifacts there fairly soon! These are powered by [Nix](https://nixos.org/), in order to ensure that builds are, in fact, reproducible!
> * We've bumped the minimum required .NET version to .NET 10! This brings a whole swath of performance improvements.
> * Made the HTTP/network error handling behavior more configurable
> * Removed deprecated synchronous methods for resolving unauthenticated media download URLs
> * Reworked how the synapse admin room list filtering works to be more generic and based on OOP rather than bespoke objects.
> * ***BREAKING***: StateEvent/StateEventResponse have been renamed to MatrixEvent/MatrixEventResponse! This was long overdue, but clarifies that these are for any matrix events, not just state events! Similarly, EventContent has been renamed to MatrixEventContent, as well as any related methods.
> 
> #### *And, as always:*
>   - The code is available at [cgit.rory.gay](https://cgit.rory.gay/matrix/LibMatrix.git) or [GitHub](https://github.com/Rory-LibMatrix/LibMatrix)!
>     - All contributions are more than welcome, be it documentation, code, anything! Perhaps, example usecases, bots, ...?
>   - Discussion, suggestions and ideas are welcome in [#libmatrix:rory.gay](https://matrix.to/#/#libmatrix:rory.gay) (Space: [#libmatrix-space:rory.gay](https://matrix.to/#/#libmatrix-space:rory.gay))
>   - Got a cool project that you're working on and want to share, using LibMatrix? Be sure to let us know, we'd love to hear all about it!

### matrix-rust-sdk ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk))

Your all-in-one toolkit for creating Matrix clients with Rust, from simple bots to full-featured apps, with bindings to Swift, Kotlin, WebAssembly, Go and more, sponsored by Element.

[Ivan 🦀](https://matrix.to/#/@mnt_io:matrix.org) reports

> It's been a long time… Time flies! Too much happened, so it's going to be a highlight this time!
> 
> #### Latest Event, Event Cache, and Timeline
> 
> The new Latest Event API was blocked by another project: redecryption. So far, when an event is received but cannot be decrypted, the Timeline was running a task listening to various sources of information and was trying to re-decrypt the event. It was working nicely! The problem is that events were re-decrypted inside the Timeline, which is an in-memory structure. Events were stored as UTD (Unable To Decrypt) events inside the Event Cache (the database holding all events). So the project consisted at implementing the redecryption inside the Event Cache directly! The main part of this project can be found in [#5746](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5746), which unblocks many features —including the Latest Event— and fixes a couple of bugs!
> 
> #### Badge Counter
> 
> We all know how irritating it is when the app displays a new notification, you open the app, and you see nothing. Yeah. Sadly, we know. We have a path to fix this. But the journey starts with the cross-process lock. This is a novel API we've implemented ensuring only one process can have an access to a particular resource, like a database. This is really important on iOS for example, when the notification process can be fired concurrently to the main app process. We have recently improved this API by adding the notion of “dirty”: a process can obtain a lock, but the process is informed that the obtained resource is dirty, which means it has been obtained by another process meanwhile, and the current process should reload its in-memory state. The meta issue is [#4874](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues/4874), and the foundation for this has been implemented and has landed in a couple of Matrix clients already. We are using this API to invalidate/reload the Media store, the Event Cache store, and the Crypto store for example. This is absolutely required to solve the Badge Counter issue.
> 
> #### Space
> 
> Space is an active project! We are implementing more features (like having live ordering!), more MSC, and we are experimenting several UI. Nothing has landed, but so you know, we are actively working on it.
> 
> #### Improved performance with SQLite
> 
> The sun was bright, the birds were singing, like any other days, except that Element X Android was too slow. And that morning, we wanted to solve this problem. It led us to visit numerous parts of the stack, but the summary of this journey is: we went from 600ms to 25ms to open a room on Android. On some old devices, it was sometimes taking 2-3s, and now it's constantly 25ms! The most notable patches are [#5841](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5841) for the SQLite part, [#5854](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5854) for the compilation part (enabling SIMD), and [#5833](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5833) or [#5827](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5827) for the SDK part. Note that the impact on iOS was also great but barely noticeable, from 20ms to 10ms to open a room.
> 
> #### QR code login
> 
> QR code login is an exciting project: grab one device, generate a QR code, scan it with another device, boom, you're connected, all keys setup etc. There are 4 sides to QR code login: new device scans, new device generates the QR code, old device scans, and old device generates the QR code. We initially implemented only one side: new device scans. Now all of them are implemented: [#5711](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5711), [#5801](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5801), and [#5818](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5818). All flows are being implemented in the Element X clients, but maybe other clients are working on it too.
> 
> #### Don't panic
> 
> We've fixed numerous bugs about Sliding Sync, auth, Matrix versions, UniFFI, cryptography and so on! The list would be too long… but it drains too much time to track and to fix.
