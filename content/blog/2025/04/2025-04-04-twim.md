[Dome](@dome:ztfr.de) reports:

> During the last couple of days, I was heavily invested in the implementation of MatrixRTC for my synapse HS. Given my special circumstances using a synology NAS the typical way to implement was not working or at least only with some modifications regarding e.g. the reverse proxy setup. That being said, the people from [#webrtc:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/%23webrtc:matrix.org) supported me heavily debugging all the problems I had to deal with. Eventually, we were able to set it up, and I immediately started to write a short how to about the setup and what needs to be done to implement the new MatrixRTC tech stack. You can read about it under the following link. Maybe this contribution will help other people facing the same issues I experienced initially. Anyways without this community I would have been stuck perhaps indefinitely. So, thanks again especially to [spaetz](https://matrix.to/#/@spaetz:sspaeth.de) and [Florian Heese](https://matrix.to/#/@fheese:element.io).

### Matrix Rooms Search update

[Aine [don't DM]](https://matrix.to/#/@aine:etke.cc) reports

> Long time no see!
>
> The Matrix Rooms Search project is a search engine for public Matrix rooms across the Federation (for servers publishing their room directories via Federation) developed by [etke.cc](https://etke.cc/). Its demo instance, [MatrixRooms.info](https://matrixrooms.info/) is the one providing Federation Stats in the weekly TWIM entries.
>
> Thanks to Sky's idea in the [#mrs:etke.cc](https://matrix.to/#/#mrs:etke.cc) room, MRS now supports per-room contact details for [sending reports alongside MSC1929 support](https://github.com/etkecc/mrs/blob/main/docs/msc1929.md).
>
> **What?**
>
> As a room administrator/moderator, you can now add a special entry to your room's topic with your email address. If your room will be reported on an MRS instance (enabled on [MatrixRooms.info](https://matrixrooms.info/)), you will receive an email about the report to the mailbox you specified in the topic, and could act on it.
>
> **Why?**
>
> Previously MRS supported only **homeservers** contacts, leaving room owners unaware about the reports, and without an option to appeal or take an action. But from now on, room owners' contacts will be treated the same way as homeservers' owners, keeping everyone informed about a potential issue.
>
> We hope that will make Matrix Federation a safer place for everyone!

> Check the [source code](https://github.com/etkecc/mrs), try it yourself on [MatrixRooms.info](https://matrixrooms.info/), and say hi in the [#mrs:etke.cc](https://matrix.to/#/#mrs:etke.cc)

> We have finished migrating to Codeberg!
>
> Our repo is officially at <https://codeberg.org/synadm/synadm>. The GitHub repository will soon be archived, so please continue on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/synadm/synadm).
>
> If you have made a PR/issue/a comment on either, you can make the GitHub profiles in the Codeberg repository link to your Codeberg profile instead by signing in with GitHub on Codeberg, then linking your existing Codeberg account or creating a new one. (If you do this, you cannot undo the profile linking to your Codeberg profile, even after removing GitHub as a sign-in method.)
>
> Installation remains the same. If you have cloned the git repository, you will need to change the URL. Here's a handy command: `git remote set-url origin https://codeberg.org/synadm/synadm`

> Finally, we have a Matrix room at [#synadm:peek-a-boo.at](https://matrix.to/#/#synadm:peek-a-boo.at) if you have any further questions.
