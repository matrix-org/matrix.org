## Dept of *Status of Matrix* 🌡️

[Matthew](https://matrix.to/#/@matthew:matrix.org) reports

> We've recently seen serious spam attacks against Matrix, so we're introducing Policy Servers to recommend whether servers should accept or discard events *before* they get synced to clients. If your server participates in public rooms, see <https://matrix.org/blog/2025/04/introducing-policy-servers> to keep it safe.

### Fractal ([website](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal))

Matrix messaging app for GNOME written in Rust.

[Kévin Commaille](https://matrix.to/#/@zecakeh:tedomum.net) says

> Here comes Fractal 11.rc. New since 11.beta:
>
> * Rearranged account settings, with a new Safety tab
> * New setting to toggle media preview visibility
> * Sessions can be renamed
> * Support for login using the OAuth 2.0 API (as used by matrix.org, which recently made the switch to Matrix Authentication Service)
> * Contiguous state events are grouped behind a single item
>
> But what does RC stand for? Really Cool? Reasonably Complete? Rose Colored¹? Release Candidate, of course! That means it should be mostly stable and we expect to only include minor improvements until the release of Fractal 11.
>
> As usual, this release includes other improvements, fixes and new translations thanks to all our contributors, and our upstream projects.
>
> It is available to install via Flathub Beta, see the [instructions in our README](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/fractal#installation-instructions).
>
> If you want to join the fun, you can try to fix one of our [newcomers issues](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/fractal/-/issues/?label_name%5B%5D=4.%20Newcomers). We are always looking for new contributors!
>
> ¹ That was actually once true, with Fractal 9.rc.

### Element X Android ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-android))

Android Matrix messenger application using the Matrix Rust SDK and Jetpack Compose.

[Benoit](https://matrix.to/#/@benoit.marty:matrix.org) says

> * We've made a security release 25.04.2 this week. Make sure to install the latest version of the application from the PlayStore (F-Droid build is in progress)
> * We are working on improving accessibility of the application specifically on the timeline. Also fixing bugs regarding the screen reader. Some UI elements were not focusable.
> * In the mean time, we're helping the moderation team by adding ability to block and report room and invitation.

### [MatrixRooms.info](https://matrixrooms.info/) Updates

[Aine [don't DM]](https://matrix.to/#/@aine:etke.cc) says

> [MatrixRooms.info](https://matrixrooms.info/) is a demo [MRS](https://github.com/etkecc/mrs) instance by [etke.cc](https://etke.cc/) that provides you the weekly Federation Stats, and today I'd like to tell about the website updates made by beastafk
>
> **Communities spotlight**
>
> On the main page of the website, a new section has been added - communities spotlight. It randomly picks one of the example search terms and shows the most relevant (small) communities that need *you*. We hope that section will help smaller Matrix rooms to be discovered and grow!
>
> *this section has strict filters (members: 5-500, language: English, avatar: must be set), but sometimes there are no rooms eligible for the filter criteria, in that case, just the first 10 most relevant rooms are shown as a workaround*
>
> **Search relevancy modes**
>
> Previously, the website scored search results by members (highest priority), and relevancy (lower priority). Now you choose what relevancy mode you prefer - most relevant (but usually small) rooms, or highest members count (less relevant)
>
> **Option to not share report with homeserver and room admins**
>
> When you report a room, there is a new option that prevents sharing the report with homeserver and room admins of the reported room, useful when the admins themselves are bad actions, [details](https://github.com/etkecc/mrs/issues/3)
>
> **And much more smaller changes!**
>
> Apart from the new features described above, the website got plenty of smaller updates and visual fixes
>
> Check it out on [MatrixRooms.info](https://matrixrooms.info/)
