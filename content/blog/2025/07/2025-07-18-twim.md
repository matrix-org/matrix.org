## Dept of *Status of Matrix* 🌡️

[Matthew](https://matrix.to/#/@matthew:matrix.org) reports

> On Wednesday we [pre-disclosed a major security update](/blog/2025/07/security-predisclosure/?update) on the horizon (codename Hydra) to improve state resets and related federation issues in Matrix.  This requires a coordinated security release across all Matrix servers, so that servers running in untrusted federations (e.g. the public Matrix network) can speak the upcoming new room version (v12).
> 
> **We have just pushed back the date for the coordinated security release to Aug 11th 2025**, as we've heard a lot of feedback that 6 days wasn't enough for clients/bots/bridge/tooling developers to test the changes introduced by room v12, and that it also doesn't give enough time for community admins to prepare for the necessary room upgrades. Underestimating the time needed here for client/community testing is entirely our fault, due to being overfocused on coordinating the significant serverside work needed. Pushing back the release date by 3 weeks gives everyone more time to test and prepare. We've also opened up registration on the `beta.matrix.org` homeserver, which is already running v12 rooms by default, to make it easier for client developers to test their clients. We've also made one clarification below for client developers, explaining the new permissions needed to send `m.room.tombstone` events.

> The Matrix Foundation and [Website & Content Working Group](@/foundation/working-groups/index.md) are excited to announce the introduction of the "Homeserver" section to the matrix.org website! 🎉 You can find it at [https://matrix.org/homeserver/](@/homeserver/_index.md) and in the navbar a the top of the page or hamburger menu on mobile.
> 
> This is the central place to learn all about the homeserver instance provided to the public by the Matrix Foundation. From here, it is now easy to browse all the relevant info, including system status, news, system notices, legal documents, and even preliminary info about the premium accounts currently still being finalised. We already have some more info in the pipe we want to add, but if you find some missing info, let us know in the [website's GitHub issues](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/issues)!

### Element X iOS ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios))

A total rewrite of Element iOS using the Matrix Rust SDK underneath and targeting devices running iOS 16+.

[Doug](https://matrix.to/#/@douge:matrix.org) announces

> Having had a focus on improving the app’s accessibility for the past few weeks, this week we decided to take a look at automatically running Xcode’s Accessibility Audits for all of our views. This has helped us identify issues such as missing VoiceOver elements, small tap target sizes and views that might not scale well with changes to the Dynamic Type size.

> Amongst other things its just really cool to watch these tests run:

> `vodozemac-python` 0.9.0 has been (finally) published, with python bindings to the rust library at the same version.
> 
> It also comes with new exposed attributes, cleaner unit tests, and most importantly, prebuilt wheels for python3.14!
> 
> During the course of creating this release, it also revealed bugs with vodozemac's exposure of the dehydrated accounts functionality, which could not be supported in the python bindings for this release, unfortunately.
