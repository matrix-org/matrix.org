## Dept of Servers 🏢

### continuwuity ([website](https://continuwuity.org/))

Continuwuity is a community-driven Matrix homeserver in Rust

[nex (she/it) [Continuwuity]](https://matrix.to/#/@nex:continuwuity.org) reports

> Huh, [these are the hilltops?](/blog/2025/06/27/this-week-in-matrix-2025-06-27/#continuwuity-website:~:text=I%27ll%20shout%20to%20the%20hilltops%20again%20next%20time%20we%27ve%20got%20another%20release%20inbound)
> 
> The British summer might have been trying to take half of the continuwuity team, but thankfully, it didn't work. Unlike **the continuwuity 0.5.0-rc.7 release**, which _is_ working, and in fact, working better than ever! Despite _many_ setbacks since [our last release, 0.5.0-rc.6](@/blog/2025/06/2025-06-27-twim.md#continuwuity-website), we've **merged 35 pull requests**, and **closed 12 issues**! Our [#main:continuwuity.org](https://matrix.to/#/#main:continuwuity.org) also reached **300 members**, and from our janky measurements, we discovered around 150 publicly federated deployments of Continuwuity. In addition, our [GitHub mirror](https://github.com/continuwuity/continuwuity/stargazers) also recently [surpassed 60 stars](https://github.com/continuwuity/continuwuity/stargazers)! We can't thank everyone enough for the support ❤️
> 
> Enough yap though, I know you're here for the juicy parts of the changelog, hand curated for you (since most people probably don't read the changelog anyway).
> 
> #### You've got mail! 📥
> 
> Here's just a couple things from our [**full changelog**](https://forgejo.ellis.link/continuwuation/continuwuity/releases/tag/v0.5.0-rc.7):
> 
> * 🕵️ **[Policy Server](@/blog/2025/04/2025-04-17-introducing-policy-servers.md) support is now fully implemented**! Now there's only tuna in your timeline, not spam 🐟️ ([#857](https://forgejo.ellis.link/continuwuation/continuwuity/pulls/857))
> * 🚀 **Upgrading a room will now update its space references**, meaning you don't need to manually re-add rooms to spaces after upgrading. Upgrading a space now also keeps the references to all the rooms inside of it. ([#907](https://forgejo.ellis.link/continuwuation/continuwuity/pulls/907))
> * 🤖 In an effort to make the server easier to run in an open-registration context, we **added support for reCaptcha** during the registration flow. OIDC/next-gen auth is still a work in progress, but hopefully this will offer some protection in the meantime! ([#900](https://forgejo.ellis.link/continuwuation/continuwuity/pulls/900))
> * 🔍 The ability to **entirely disable read receipts and typing indicators** has been added, so even people on your own server won't know when you've read their DM but mentally tuned out of the conversation. ([#898](https://forgejo.ellis.link/continuwuation/continuwuity/pulls/898))
> * 🚫 **User suspension** and **suspend on register** have both been added, allowing for greater trust and safety for shared & public servers. ([#876](https://forgejo.ellis.link/continuwuation/continuwuity/pulls/876), [#887](https://forgejo.ellis.link/continuwuation/continuwuity/pulls/887))
> 
> And just because why not, Jade threw in some changes that have resulted in sweeping performance improvements across the board!
> 
> Huge thanks to members of the community, such as [Shuroii](https://forgejo.ellis.link/Shuroii) and [transgwender](https://forgejo.ellis.link/transgwender) for contributing fixes to the Nix flake, [Oddlid](https://forgejo.ellis.link/oddlid) for the read receipts & typing indicator changes, [rooot](https://forgejo.ellis.link/rooot/) for implementing additional federation timeout configuration granularity. It's awesome to see members of the community contributing, and we can't wait to see more in future!
> 
> #### Gimme gimme! 🫴
> 
> Manners! Say please next time.
> **You can download the latest release [on our forge](https://forgejo.ellis.link/continuwuation/continuwuity/releases/tag/v0.5.0-rc.7)**. Docker images are also available using [`forgejo.ellis.link/continuwuation/continuwuity:latest`](https://forgejo.ellis.link/continuwuation/-/packages/container/continuwuity/latest).
> 
> We don't currently mirror our releases anywhere yet, however, our source code is also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/continuwuity/continuwuity), [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/continuwuity/continuwuity/), and [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/continuwuity/continuwuity). A few members of the community also mirror, some include releases, so if you have issues with any/all of the forges above, don't hesitate to join our community (below) and ask!
> 
> #### What's next ✨
> 
> Gosh, it never stops does it! Well, I suppose you can have more, as a treat. BUT, the powers that be (my dopamine receptors) tell me that I have to ask that you [give us a star on GitHub](https://github.com/continuwuity/continuwuity/stargazers), as it helps us get promoted to people who might not have heard of us :)
> 
> You can also [#main:continuwuity.org](https://matrix.to/#/#main:continuwuity.org), and explore our [#space:continuwuity.org](https://matrix.to/#/#space:continuwuity.org), where we have a room for important announcements, a rich offtopic room, and our dev room where we discuss features and bugs.
> If you run your own continuwuity server, you should also [#announcements:continuwuity.org](https://matrix.to/#/#announcements:continuwuity.org), as important announcements are sent there (and may not be mirrored to the main room).
> 
> Anyway, as per usual, most things we're planning to tackle are [on our issue tracker](https://forgejo.ellis.link/continuwuation/continuwuity/issues), or in a [pull request](https://forgejo.ellis.link/continuwuation/continuwuity/pulls).
> 
> ##### Got a penny to spare? 🪙
> 
> Although we will never charge to use continuwuity, hetzner keeps sending me this funny email saying I owe them money or something, so I figured it doesn't hurt to mention that we do accept donations. If you would like to, and are able to, feel free to send a few coins in the direction of [myself](https://timedout.uk/donate.html) or [Jade](https://github.com/sponsors/JadedBlueEyes)!

## Dept of Clients 📱

### Neochat ([website](https://invent.kde.org/network/neochat))

A client for matrix, the decentralized communication protocol

[Tobias Fella](https://matrix.to/#/@tobiasfella:kde.org) says

> It's been... a while since the last update on NeoChat, so I won't go into all the details of what we've done since last time; instead, you'll just hear some of the highlights from the last weeks:
> 
> * We're preparing for the new room version. Current versions of NeoChat already work mostly fine, just a few small touch-ups were required.
> * Joshua has made many small improvements to the user interface, like showing useful information when viewing a room invitation.
> * Tobias has gone over our crash reports and fixed a few of the most common crashes.
> * James made it possible to configure the behavior for when a room is marked as read.
> * In the background, our work on using matrix-rust-sdk-crypto for end-to-end encryption is progressing.

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰

### matrix-rust-sdk ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk))

Your all-in-one toolkit for creating Matrix clients with Rust, from simple bots to full-featured apps, with bindings to Swift, Kotlin, WebAssembly, Go and more

[poljar](https://matrix.to/#/@poljar:matrix.org) reports

> As the summer comes along, things continue to improve. The team has welcomed two
> interns who are working on exciting new features in the SDK:
> 
> * [Shrey](https://github.com/dragonfly1033/) is implementing full text search support for end-to-end encrypted rooms.
> * [Skye](https://github.com/kaylendog) is tackling encrypted state events as proposed in [MSC3414](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3414).
> 
> This week also brought a variety of improvements across the SDK:
> 
> * Room version 12 support has landed, thanks to [Kévin Commaille](https://github.com/zecakeh)
>   ([#5436](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5436), [#5433](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5433), [#5337](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5337))
> 
> * Exclude insecure devices:  
>   Work continues on strengthening encryption by allowing clients to ignore unverified devices  
>   ([#5319](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5319))
> 
> * MSRV bumped to 1.88 to enable use of `let`-chains and other 2024 edition features  
>   ([#5432](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5432))
> 
> * Leaving rooms now also leaves their predecessors, improving behavior in room upgrades  
>   ([#5418](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5418)) – thanks to
>   our intern [Shrey](https://github.com/dragonfly1033/)!
> 
> * Downloads are no longer cancelled after 30 seconds. You can now download big media files.
>   ([#5437](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5437))
> 
> * Threaded messaging APIs got a cleanup, making it easier to send messages in threads  
>   ([#5427](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5427))

### Matrix Connectivity-Tester Alerts

[MTRNord (they/them)](https://matrix.to/#/@mtrnord:mtrnord.blog) reports

> Hi everyone, this week I bring you a few new things :)
> 
> Additionally, you can now find a staging deployment at <https://stage.connectivity-tester.mtrnord.blog/> next to the stable deployment at <https://connectivity-tester.mtrnord.blog/>
> If you find any errors, please report them via <https://github.com/MTRNord/rust-federation-tester> or <https://github.com/MTRNord/matrix-connection-tester-ui/>.
> 
> #### Email Alerts
> 
> The service now supports automated email alerts. You can register for them, and it will check roughly every hour and email you if the check failed. This should allow you to have a better overview of your system and spot bugs when you make changes more easily.
> 
> #### OpenAPI docs for the backend
> 
> The backend now automatically generates some OpenAPI docs at `/api-docs` of the API. This is an ongoing thing and not fully entirely correct yet, but it is hopefully only getting more complete.
> 
> Also note that as part of this work, the API surface changed quite a bit. In case you used the API, you will need to change things.
> 
> #### Roadmap
> 
> As part of the future goals, I am currently in progress of splitting the UI into server-server and client-server API checks. I am hoping to get this done rather soonish so it is easier to read the check results.

## Matrix in the News 📰

[Benedict](https://matrix.to/#/@benedict:imbitbu.de) says

> Last week, all statutory health insurance companies in Germany (more than 90) released the TI-Messenger for patients and integrated it into their electronic patient records apps. This means that ca. 75 million patients can now theoretically talk to their healthcare providers. The TI-Messenger is based on Matrix in a closed federation. As far as I know, there are five manufacturers and they are using Open Source Software from the Matrix ecosystem. Four of them use Trixnity in the client and all use Synapse in the backend. Unfortunately, there are also many that don't give anything in return.
