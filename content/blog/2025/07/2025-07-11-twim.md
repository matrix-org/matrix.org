## Dept of Spec 📜

[Andrew Morgan (anoa) {he/him}](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io) says

> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <https://spec.matrix.org/proposals>.
> 
> ### MSC Status
> 
> **New MSCs:**
> 
> * [MSC4310: MatrixRTC decline `m.rtc.notify`](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4310)
> * [MSC4309: Finalised delayed event on sync](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4309)
> * [MSC4308: Thread Subscriptions extension to Sliding Sync](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4308)
> * [MSC4307: Validate that `auth_events` are in the correct room](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4307)
> * [MSC4306: Thread Subscriptions](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4306)
> * [MSC4291: Room IDs as hashes of the create event](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4291)
> 
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
> 
> * [MSC4222: Adding `state_after` to `/sync`](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4222) (merge)
> * [MSC4210: Remove legacy mentions](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4210) (merge)
> 
> **Accepted MSCs:**
> 
> * _No MSCs were accepted this week._
> 
> **Closed MSCs:**
> 
> * [MSC1998: Two-Factor Authentication Providers](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1998)
> * [MSC3741: Revealing the useful login flows to clients after a soft logout](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3741)
> * [MSC3105: Previewing UIA flows](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3105)
>     - The above 3 MSCs were closed due to dealing with the old auth system, which has been made obsolete by Matrix's next-gen auth system.
> * [\[WIP\] MSC4051: Using the create event as the room ID](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4051)
>     - Superseded by [MSC4291](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/4291)

[tulir](https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net) announces

> #### MSC highlight: Room IDs as hashes of the create event
> You may have noticed some placeholder MSCs being opened in the past half a year. One of them has now received content ahead of the others:
> 
> [MSC4291](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4291) redefines room IDs to be the hash of the `m.room.create` event. As a part of the change, the server name component is being removed. If any software you maintain assumes that the server name is present in room IDs, you should stop parsing room IDs or at least fail gracefully if the server name isn't there.
> 
> We're going to propose FCP on MSC4291 in the next few days and a new stable room version including that and other security-sensitive changes from the placeholder MSCs is expected to follow relatively soon as well.

## Dept of Clients 📱

### Element X iOS ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios))

[Mauro Romito](https://matrix.to/#/@mauro.romito:element.io) says

> * Further improved accessibility in our app
> * Introduces the development flag `share pos` which allows the SSS to resume the sync where it left off, however since is still an unstable feature the flag is off by default.

## Dept of VoIP 🤙

### Element Call ([website](https://call.element.io))

Native Decentralised End-to-end Encrypted Group Calls in Matrix.

[Timo K.](https://matrix.to/#/@toger5:matrix.org) announces

> We continue to focus on the in app VoIP experience.
> This week version [v0.13.0](https://github.com/element-hq/element-call/releases/tag/v0.13.0) and [v0.13.1](https://github.com/element-hq/element-call/releases/tag/v0.13.1) were released:
> 
> #### [Native audio device handling for in-app calling](https://github.com/element-hq/element-call/releases/tag/v0.13.0)
> 
> This release delivers a significant upgrade to the audio experience, with a particular focus on mobile devices. We've enhanced Element Call to provide a more native, phone-call-like experience when used within Element X.
> 
> Key improvements include:
> 
> * Support for earpiece audio output on both Android and iOS
> * Convenient toggle button in the main menu to switch between earpiece and loudspeaker modes
> * Proximity sensor integration that automatically turns off the screen when the device is held against your ear in earpiece mode
> 
> These changes represent a major step forward in making Element Call feel like a natural extension of your device's native calling capabilities.
>

> ([#5343](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5343))
> 
> We now cache the supported server versions retrieved from the `/versions` endpoint, reducing unnecessary network requests when initializing a client.  
> ([#5357](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5357))
> 
> The FFI bindings can now dynamically reconfigure the file path where logs are stored.  
> ([#5380](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5380))
> 
> Finally, we’ve started migrating the codebase to the **Rust 2024 edition**, thanks to Jonas Platte.
