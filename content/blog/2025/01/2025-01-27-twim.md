## Dept of Spec 📜

[Andrew Morgan (anoa) {he/him}](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:element.io) says

> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <https://spec.matrix.org/proposals>.
>
>
> ### MSC Status
>
> **New MSCs:**
>
> * [MSC4256: RFC 9420 MLS mode Matrix](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4256)
> * [MSC4255: Bulk Profile Updates](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4255)
>
> **MSCs in Proposed Final Comment Period:**
>
> * [MSC3765: Rich text in room topics](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3765)
> * [MSC3266: Room summary API](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3266)
> * [MSC3757: Restricting who can overwrite a state event](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3757)
> * [MSC4183: Additional Error Codes for submitToken endpoint](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4183)
> * [MSC2965: OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata discovery](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2965)
>
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
>
> * [MSC4239: Room version 11 as the default room version](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4239) (merge)
> * [MSC4133: Extending User Profile API with Key:Value Pairs](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4133) (merge)
>     * FCP currently blocked due to an ongoing discussion.
>
> **Accepted MSCs:**

> * [MSC4213: Remove server_name parameter from `join` and `knock` endpoints](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4213)
>
> **Closed MSCs:**
>
> * [MSC3975: rel_type for Replies](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3975)
>     * Closed by the MSC author.
>
> ### Spec Updates
>
> Quite a flurry of activity in spec-land this week, as you can see from the above! [MSC4133: Extending User Profile API with Key:Value Pairs](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4133) moved into final comment period. While it still has one outstanding concern as of today, hopefully that can be worked out in the near future.
>
> We also had a newly accepted MSC; [MSC4213: Remove server_name parameter from `join` and `knock` endpoints](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4213). A small change, but a nice clean up to the spec.
>
> Once again, thanks to everyone who's involved, and those that are only just getting started! The more the merrier.

## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Synapse ([website](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/))

Synapse is a Matrix homeserver implementation developed by Element

[Till](https://matrix.to/#/@s7evink:matrix.org) reports

> This week we released [Synapse v1.123.0rc1](https://github.com/element-hq/synapse/releases/tag/v1.123.0rc1).
>
> A noteworthy change in this version is the experimental implementation for [MSC4133: Extending User Profile API with Key:Value Pairs](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4133). A new endpoint for [MSC2965: OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server Metadata discovery](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2965) was added as well.
>
> The usual round of bug fixes and dependency upgrade are also present.

[Matthew](https://matrix.to/#/@matthew:matrix.org) reports

> We've updated the "massive Synapse deployments require Synapse Pro" blog post to clarify that open source Synapse is still the primary homeserver from Element, and core performance work and new features will continue to happen there and land there first (hopefully driven by $ from Synapse Pro): <https://element.io/blog/scaling-to-millions-of-users-requires-synapse-pro/#update>

[f0x](https://matrix.to/#/@f0x:pixie.town) says

> Synapse EDU Limiter
>
> An experimental proxy to limit the amount of EDU transactions Synapse federates to other homeservers. Intercepts typing notifications from local clients, and only passes them through to Synapse if they are sent to a room with less than 400 remote servers (configurable). Might add support for presence events in the future.
>
> Trying this out after Synapse performance heavily degraded again, after a single user typed a couple of times in a room with 800 participating homeservers.
> [Because it sent more than 50 thousand requests in an hour just for typing notifications](https://stats.pixie.town/d/synapse-new/synapse?var-bucket_size=$__auto&orgId=1&from=2025-01-22T12:08:44.878Z&to=2025-01-22T14:52:37.494Z&timezone=browser&var-datasource=default&var-instance=pixie.town&var-job=$__all&var-index=$__all&viewPanel=panel-111).

> The new Quaternion beta is coming out, with the new nice visualisation for replies and a bunch of other features and bug fixes. The final release is coming real soon now - translators and packagers, it's a good moment for you to step in and do your part! The release notes are (coming) in the usual place at <https://github.com/quotient-im/Quaternion/releases>

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰

### matrix-rust-sdk ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk))

Next-gen crypto-included SDK for developing Clients, Bots and Appservices; written in Rust with bindings for Node, Swift and WASM

[poljar](https://matrix.to/#/@poljar:matrix.org) announces

> This week saw a flew of smaller refactorings and improvements in the SDK:
>
> * The `matrix_auth` and `oidc` modules were moved into the `authentication` module ([#4575](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4575)).
> * The usage of the Tokio-based `timeout()` and `sleep()` functions was removed, which should move us closer towards full WASM support ([#4573](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4573)).
> * We re-enabled HTTP2 support, which was accidentally disabled by upstream changes ([#4566](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4566)).
> * A fix has landed to avoid adding non-pinned events to the pinned-events timeline when back paginating. ([#4555](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4555)).
> * Use the updated dehydrated device format specified in [MSC3184](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3814) ([#4421](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4421)).

## Dept of Bots 🤖

### Draupnir ([website](https://github.com/the-draupnir-project/Draupnir))

A moderation bot for open Matrix communities

[Gnuxie 💜🐝](https://matrix.to/#/@gnu_ponut:matrix.org) announces

>
> * When the room state backing store is in use, room state will immediately be refreshed in the background after startup. Previously this would happen lazily whenever state changed within a room.
> * A few bugs where Draupnir wouldn't respond to pings / mentions from schildichat, element web, and element x have now been fixed.
> * It is now possible to reinvite members who were banned while using the `unban` command via a new `--invite` option.
>
> For the full list of changes and fixes, please read the changelog [here](https://github.com/the-draupnir-project/Draupnir/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v202-2025-01-24). See you in [#draupnir:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#draupnir:matrix.org)!

## Dept of Interesting Projects 🛰️

### MLS mode Matrix

[Dirk](https://matrix.to/#/@kird:matrix.org) reports

> #### 👋 Hey everyone
>
> Today is the day we ([BWI GmbH](https://messenger.bwi.de/)) have released [MSC4256](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4256) for Matrix! This is the first big step towards combining decentralized infrastructure with modern encryption.
> The goal? Even more secure, efficient and scalable communication 💬 – open and free for everyone.
>
> #### ❓Why all this?
>
> * We want to bring together the best of both worlds 🌍 - the flexibility of Matrix and the state-of-the-art security of Message Layer Security (MLS). In addition to security, a particular goal is to improve communication in large groups - and finally defeat the final boss “unable to decrypt” 🥷.
> * the Basis for more: MLS is an important step for preparing the BundesMessenger for VS-NfD communication 🛡️. This is just a first step, but a very important one.
>
> #### 💌 Shoutout to Element & our partners
>
> Element was an inspiration 💡 to us with their suggestions for using MLS ([dMLS](https://gitlab.matrix.org/uhoreg/matrix-dmls) & [Linearized Matrix](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ralston-mimi-linearized-matrix/)). Unfortunately, these approaches did not fit 100% with our specific requirements in our Messengers. But that's exactly what motivated us to take action ourselves 💪 – with [Cryspen](https://cryspen.com/) and [Famedly](https://famedly.com/) at our side. A huge thank you to - Franziskus, Karthik, Jan, Niklas & Nicolas – you really did go through the Matrix and MLS! 🎮
>
> We look forward to continue to work with the Matrix Foundation and the community on [MSC4244](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/blob/travis/msc/mls/00-core/proposals/4244-rfc9420-mls-for-matrix.md) and [MSC4256](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4256) to create the best 💯 for the entire Matrix world.
>
> #### 🛏️ Now it's your turn
>
> * Check the MSC: Take a look at [MSC4256](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4256) and get involved 📢.
> * Give feedback: We want to hear everything – what's going well 👍, what's going wrong ❌ and what we can do even better 🛠️.
> * Be a nerd 🤓: Grab the [Code](https://gitlab.opencode.de/bwi/bundesmessenger/mls) on OpenCode and try it yourself. The client is a real beauty 🥰
>
> #### 🎉 Let the party begin
>
> We look forward to continue to work together 🤝 and open on this MSC to achieve the best results.
>
> Now lets start testing 🧪! We look forward to hear your opinions and ideas. This is just the beginning of an exciting journey 🚀 towards more secure and confident communication.

## Dept of Gaming 🎮️

[Half-Shot](https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk) says

> Hey folks. So anyone that has already watched the Matrix live will know that I'm working on a project to build a
> worms-like in the browser, using Matrix as a network transport. This project has been on the go for two years, and
> as of the last couple of weeks finally features a networking implementation.
>
> Want to give it a go? Head to [half-shot.github.io/wormgine](https://half-shot.github.io/wormgine) and have a play :)
>
> There is currently no release channel so updates arrive as I build them, so you might find repeat trips to that URL
> will give you more things to play with.
>
> Come chat to us over at [#kobold-kombat:half-shot.uk](https://matrix.to/#/#kobold-kombat:half-shot.uk) to get involved!
