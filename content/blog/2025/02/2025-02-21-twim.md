[Thib (m.org)](https://matrix.to/#/@thibaultmartin:matrix.org) reports

> The Foundation is at a crossroads. We need to raise an additional $610K to break-even, and more immediately to raise $100K to keep our bridges running.
> 
> As a neutral custodian for the specification and much more, the Foundation is key to the success of Matrix. It is time to step up for it.

## Dept of Governance ⚖️

[Gwmngilfen](https://matrix.to/#/@gwmngilfen:matrix.org) reports

> ### Announcing the Governing Board Working Groups process
> 
> The Governing Board has news! If you have been itching to know how to get involved, we are now ready to get you ... on-Board! 🥁 😀
> 
> The Working Groups are the beating heart of the GB - they get the work done. So naturally people have been asking "how do we make one?" and "what is expected of a Working Group?"
> <!-- more -->
> #### Creating a Working Group
> 
> The process is fairly simple:
> 
> * First, find some **people** who want to work on the problem - we would suggest at least 3, but the more you have the better, as it shows the level of interest in the issue.
> * Second, write down a **charter** for your Group - this doesn't need to be huge to start with, just a few sentences about what you want to be responsible for and the outcomes you want to achieve.
> * Finally, get a Board Member to sponsor you - this means finding a Board Member who agrees with the work you want to do, and will act as your link to the rest of the Board. The [#governing-board-office:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#governing-board-office:matrix.org) is a great place to start conversations about WGs and look for sponsors. If in doubt, ping me there ( @gwmngilfen:matrix.org ) and I will help if I can.
> 
> Once you have that done, the Board Member will discuss it with the rest of the GB, we'll put it to a vote, and if it passes, you're in! (If it doesn't, we'll be sure to pass back what feedback we can about why not).
> 
> We would advise making noise about your proposals for Working Groups in the community to rally support and/or new members to get work done. TWIM is a good place for that 😛
> <!-- more-->
> #### Expectations of a Working Group
> 
> Working Groups are well named - they **work**. Some will provide advice & documents on a topic, others may produce code or similar outputs (think, a Docs WG?) but all have work to do. So, obviously you'll want to get on with that.
> 
> We also expect that:
> 
> * Working Groups will have at least a Matrix room to discuss work in asynchronously
> * they will have regular meetings ("regular" is different for different groups, but we would expect not less than monthly). These could be video or chat meetings.
> * they take minutes of the meetings - the Board member can help here, but someone should take notes if they are not available.
> 
>     - These minutes get passed up to the rest of the Board so we can all be kept up to date at a high level
> 
> Clearly there are also some longer term things that we expect, like an expectation to work well with other Working Groups, to build consensus for decisions, etc. The GB can help if things need unblocking, of course.
> 
> ### Documentation
> 
> We do need a place to record the Working Groups, what exists already, what they do, how you get involved. This will be added to the Matrix.org website SOON™️
> 
> ### Initial Working Groups
> 
> All of this is theoretical until we start creating some groups, so .. let's hear your proposals (and I have a few to post in a moment)! Let's get some work done 💪

[HarHarLinks](https://matrix.to/#/@kim:sosnowkadub.de) announces

> ## New GB Working Groups - call for members
> 
> Working Groups are the core of how the Governing Board orchestrates its work. We have some new ones for you to consider (for the first time 🎉)
> 
> ### Website WG (proposed)
> 
> The GB is considering a proposal for a Website WG! @HarHarLinks has written a charter regarding how to get work done for the main [Matrix website](https://matrix.org), and has a good initial member list. While this is de-facto work already being done, we'd like to make it official - it's been proposed by @HarHarLinks so if this sounds like something you'd be interested in, register your interest with them!
> 
> ### Events WG (proposed)
> 
> The GB is considering a proposal for a Events WG! This would cover CfPs, staffing booths, merch, event tooling (Pretix box, etc) and so on. While this is de-facto work already being done, we'd like to make it official - its [fairly detailed charter](https://hedgedoc.sosnowkadub.de/s/ChtB1BO-o#) been proposed by @HarHarLinks so if this sounds like something you'd be interested in, register your interest with them!

[Gwmngilfen](https://matrix.to/#/@gwmngilfen:matrix.org) reports

> ## Ideas for New GB Working Groups
> 
> In addition to the in-flight proposals from HarHarLinks, I have a couple of ideas that need input to get started...
> 
> ### Documentation WG (idea)
> 
> I think we could benefit from a Documentation Working Group in Matrix. The Spec pages are excellent, but much of the rest of our docs falls to the general website team, and we see a lot of copies of things like https://doc.matrix.tu-dresden.de/en which suggest to me that people aren't finding *our* docs sufficient?
> 
> So, without wanting to downplay the awesome work that has gone before, I think a dedicated Docs group could try to help specialise the various people working on the website, as well as provide a clear place to report issues with our materials. I'm willing to propose this, if you'd like to discuss it (or think it's an awful idea), please reach out to me ( @gwmngilfen:matrix.org )! in [#governing-board-office:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#governing-board-office:matrix.org) 
> 
> ### New User Experience WG (idea)
> 
> Another group I'm thinking about is the New User WG - this would be focussed on how we get more people to Matrix, and improve those first few minutes/hours/days in our ecosystem - and how to gather their feedback effectively.
> 
> During the Matrix Unconference in Brussels, I hosted a session on this, and in just 45 mins we made 2 pages of ideas, so I think it's a rich area. Outputs would be advice/suggestions to other parts of the ecosystem for how we can make things better for our newer (and especially non-tech) users. I'm willing to propose this, if you'd like to discuss it (or think it's an awful idea), please reach out to me ( @gwmngilfen:matrix.org ) in [#governing-board-office:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#governing-board-office:matrix.org) 
> 
> Got ideas of other WGs? Talk to us in [#governing-board-office:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#governing-board-office:matrix.org)! Onwards!

## Dept of Clients 📱

### Element X iOS ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios))

A total rewrite of Element-iOS using the Matrix Rust SDK underneath and targeting devices running iOS 16+.

[Doug](https://matrix.to/#/@douge:matrix.org) says

> * The next release of Element X iOS has an updated Rust SDK and as such, we will no longer support the Sliding Sync proxy - native Simplified Sliding Sync via your homeserver is the only sync option.
> * We made huge progress on embedding the Element Call web app into the Element X (rather than loading it from the web) - we are able to participate in calls, and are now just adapting the code to fully support localisation when embedded.
> * We have started implementing pills for rooms and events, just as in Element Web. The first step is to replace permalinks rendered in the timeline with these new pills.
> * We had a nice little external contribution that fixes @mention suggestions to work from anywhere in your message and not just at the end. Thanks Vickoo 🙌

### Element X Android ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-android))

Android Matrix messenger application using the Matrix Rust SDK and Jetpack Compose.

[Benoit](https://matrix.to/#/@benoit.marty:matrix.org) reports

> Working on several features currently:
> 
> * swipe between media: improvement when coming from the pinned Events list. Now merged!
> * joining room by alias (can also be called `address`)
> * user interactive verification. It's currently possible to verify your own sessions, it will be possible to verify other users
> * fixing bugs! We have fixed a bunch of ANR issue, the first stats from the PlayStore are showing a drop in the ANR occurrences.
> * new translations into Norwegian and Turkish. Thanks for all the contributors! As a reminder, anyone can help translating the mobile applications from here: https://localazy.com/p/element/ . Translations are shared between the iOS and Android application.

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰

### matrix-rust-sdk ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk))

Next-gen crypto-included SDK for developing Clients, Bots and Appservices; written in Rust with bindings for Node, Swift and WASM

[poljar](https://matrix.to/#/@poljar:matrix.org) reports

> It's been a quieter week, but progress continues! The event cache is receiving
> its final polish, including performance improvements, as it nears prime time.  
> 
> The authentication system is also seeing ongoing enhancements, thanks to [Kévin Commaille](https://matrix.to/#/@zecakeh:tedomum.net).  
> 
> Additionally, work has begun on the successor to [MSC3061](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3061), aiming
> to allow newly joined users to access the history of encrypted rooms.  
> 
> ## Event Cache Updates  
> 
> * Simplified the flow when resolving a gap ([#4691](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4691))  
> * Streamlined back-pagination logic ([#4689](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4689))  
> * Implemented lazy-loading for `EventCache` ([#4632](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4632))  
> * Significantly improved reply replacement speed by introducing an index over replies ([#4669](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4669))  
> 
> ## Authentication Improvements  
> 
> * Removed support for deserializing the old `UserSession` format that contained the `issuer_info` field ([#4679](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4679))  
> * Adopted the new `GET /auth_metadata` Matrix API endpoint ([#4673](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4673))  
> * Removed the method for authorizing arbitrary scopes ([#4664](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4664))  
> 
> ## Other Notable Changes  
> 
> * Added a new constructor to `InboundGroupSession` for easier creation from an `m.room_key` event ([#4688](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4688))  
> * Renamed snapshot files to reduce filename length, allowing Windows users to work on the codebase again ([#4625](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4625))  
> * Enabled history visibility overrides when creating a room ([#4682](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4682))  
> * Ensured that paginations and syncs don’t add events to the pinned events timeline ([#4645](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4645))

### synadm ([website](https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm))

Command line admin tool for Synapse (Matrix homeserver)

[jacksonchen666 (they/it)](https://matrix.to/#/@jacksonchen666:jacksonchen666.com) announces

> We have released synadm v0.47! This release packs a few features:
> * Connection errors to Synapse should be more reasonably small and easy to understand, thanks to [#168](https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm/pull/168).
> * `synadm user redact` is now added, which redacts a user's messages. Supports local and remote users, but intricate details are up to Synapse (see ["Redact all events of a user"](https://element-hq.github.io/synapse/latest/admin_api/user_admin_api.html#redact-all-the-events-of-a-user)).
> * You can filter for empty rooms on the server side in `synadm room list` with `--empty` or `--not-empty`. This is in addition to `synadm room purge-empty`
> * More options were added to `synadm user list` to match what Synapse supports
> * `synadm media quarantine` and `unquarantine` now have the `-U`/`--mxc-uri` argument to pass MXC URIs to
> 
> That's all in code. There are a few changes in documentation, including the theme, listed on [the changelogs](https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm/releases/tag/v0.47).
> 
> And of course, a changelog is also available on [GitHub](https://github.com/JOJ0/synadm/releases/tag/v0.47). Our room is at [#synadm:peek-a-boo.at](https://matrix.to/#/#synadm:peek-a-boo.at) if you have any questions or other stuff.
