## Dept of *Status of Matrix* 🌡️

[Quentin Gliech](https://matrix.to/#/@quenting:element.io) reports

> This week we released [Matrix Authentication Service 0.13.0](https://github.com/element-hq/matrix-authentication-service/releases/tag/v0.13.0)!
> 
> This is a big release, as we haven't done one since September.
> 
> It is fixing a lot of small issues, but here are a few of the big highlights:
> 
>  - The email verification has been completely reworked, meaning that accounts don't *require* a valid email address on them anymore! They are still required for open password registrations, but MAS won't nag you anymore to add an email to your account.
>  - No more spurious logouts when consuming a refresh token! That was a recurring annoyance for people using Element X in poor network conditions.
>  - It now reliably provisions users to Synapse! Sometimes, MAS would just stop provisioning new sessions if, for some reason, it lost connections to Postgres. This is a thing of the past, as now MAS has a reliable job queue.
>  - New translations! MAS is now available in Czech, Dutch, Estonian, English, French, German, Portuguese, Simplified Chinese, Swedish, and Ukrainian. If you'd like to help MAS get translated to *your language*, head out to our [Localazy project](https://localazy.com/p/matrix-authentication-service)
>  - Better support for non-OIDC upstream OAuth 2.0 providers. Support for 'social login' options like Google or Sign-in with Apple went from 'good' to 'great', with many UI improvements.
> 
> Upgrading should be as easy as grabbing the latest Docker image or the pre-built binaries, restarting the service and *voilà!*
> 
> Feel free to stop by [#matrix-auth:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-auth:matrix.org) to join in on the discussion and if you encounter a bug make sure to report it [here](http://github.com/element-hq/matrix-authentication-service/issues).

### matrix-tf-aws

A Fully Automated Terraform Deployment for Matrix on AWS

[rsb_tbg](https://matrix.to/#/@rsb_tbg:matrix.org) reports

> Hey everyone, check out my newly public Terraform module on GitHub! It fully automates the deployment of a **Synapse homeserver** along with **0-4 currently-supported Mautrix bridges** (Discord, Signal, Telegram, WhatsApp) on AWS—no manual setup required.
> 
> ### 🔧 What’s Included?
> 
> The module provisions the following resources:
> 
> ✅ **VPC & Networking** – Private/public subnets, NAT, security groups  
> ✅ **ECS Cluster** – Runs Synapse and selected Mautrix bridges  
> ✅ **EFS & Access Points** – Persistent storage for Synapse  
> ✅ **Aurora PostgreSQL** – Scalable, managed database  
> ✅ **S3 Buckets** – Storage for configs and logs  
> ✅ **TLS Certificate** – Secure HTTPS for your ALB  
> ✅ **Dynamic Secrets** – No hardcoded tokens/passwords; all are auto-generated  
> ✅ **And other resources** to connect everything together
> 
> ### 🚀 Getting Started
> 
> All you need before launching:
> 
> 🔹 A **Route 53 domain** for your Matrix homeserver name  
> 🔹 If using the **Telegram bridge**, a **Telegram API ID & hash**
> 
> Once you initialize the module with Terraform, you’ll have the option to customize configurations and registration files to fit your needs. You can even modify them post-deployment and simply run `terraform apply` to apply the changes.
> 
> 🔗 **Check it out here:** [https://github.com/matrix-tf/matrix-tf-aws](https://github.com/matrix-tf/matrix-tf-aws)
> 
> It’s **super easy to use**—whether you’re setting up your first Matrix server or already a pro. Hope it helps! 🚀
