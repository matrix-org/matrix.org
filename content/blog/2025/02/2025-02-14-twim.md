## Dept of Events and Talks 🗣️

### Our FOSDEM Wrap-Up post is out

[Thib (m.org)](https://matrix.to/#/@thibaultmartin:matrix.org) reports

> We could showcase our work, drown in enthusiasm, gather in smaller committee to discuss what works or what should work differently.
>
> According to one of the FOSDEM organizers themselves we have one of the most impressive booth roster they have ever seen. We can be proud to have such a solid community!
>
> And shout out again to our sponsors [Famedly](https://www.famedly.com), [Nordeck](https://nordeck.net) and [Workadventure](https://workadventu.re) for making it possible to have such a great Fringe Event!

## Dept of Clients 📱

### Quaternion 0.0.97 ([website](https://github.com/quotient-im/Quaternion))

A Qt5-based IM client for Matrix

[kitsune](https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org) reports

> A new stable version of Quaternion is out, with the timeline looks getting a bit of a refresh, E2EE being unconditionally on, and a few other nice additions. Note for packagers as well as (command-line) Flatpak users: the application id has changed from `com.github.quaternion` to `io.github.quotient_im.Quaternion`. If these words don't mean anything to you, you can most likely just ignore that change. Anyway, all the details are in the [release notes](https://github.com/quotient-im/Quaternion/releases/tag/0.0.97) and links from it, as usual.

### Fractal ([website](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal))

Matrix messaging app for GNOME written in Rust.

[Kévin Commaille](https://matrix.to/#/@zecakeh:tedomum.net) announces

> Due to a couple of unfortunate but important regressions in Fractal 10, we are releasing Fractal 10.1 so our users don’t have to wait too long for them to be addressed. This minor version fixes the following issues:
>
> * Some rooms were stuck in an unread state, even after reading them or marking them as read.
> * Joining or creating a room would crash the app.
>
> This version is available right now on [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/org.gnome.Fractal).
>
> If you want to help us avoid regressions like that in the future, you could use [Fractal Nightly](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/fractal#development-version)! Or even better, you could pick up one of [our issues](https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/fractal/-/issues) and become part of the ~~problem~~ solution.

### Element X iOS ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios))

A total rewrite of Element-iOS using the Matrix Rust SDK underneath and targeting devices running iOS 16+.

[Doug](https://matrix.to/#/@douge:matrix.org) reports

> We decided to postpone this week’s RC to next week so we will deliver the following features together:
>
> * User verification is now available directly in Element X, you no longer need to use Element Web for this 🎉
> * It is now possible to swipe between Media directly from the room timeline without having to go to the Media Browser.
> * The Knocking feature is complete (but will remain behind a feature flag until we’re ready to launch on all platforms).

### Cinny v4.3.0 ([website](https://cinny.in))

Cinny is a Matrix client focused on simplicity, elegance and security

[Lozenge](https://matrix.to/#/@kfiven:matrix.org) announces

> We’re excited to announce the release of Cinny v4.3.0, bringing a host of improvements that make your experience even better. This update introduces a refreshed design, stronger security, and new features to enhance your overall experience.
>
> * The App Settings have been revamped with a new look, following our Folds design system. This redesign creates a cleaner, more intuitive interface, making it easier to navigate and find what you need quickly.
>
> * In terms of security, we’ve made a major upgrade by replacing the deprecated libolm encryption library with vodozemac. Along with this upgrade, we’ve also fixed various verification-related bugs, ensuring a smoother and more secure experience.
>
> * Managing your devices has also been simplified. With improved device verification and simplified terminology (using MSC4161)—like Device Verification and Recovery Key—it’s now easier than ever to keep track of your devices.
>
> * We’ve also taken privacy to the next level. Sensitive information, such as your IP address, Recovery Key, and Access token, are now hidden by default, minimizing any potential risks to your security.
>
> * For the custom emoji lovers, you’ll be happy to know that personal emojis and stickers can now be imported in bulk, saving you time and hassle when creating personal packs.
> * Additionally, users can now pin messages in rooms, making it easier to highlight important information and keep key messages front and center.
>
> * Lastly, for our more advanced users, we’ve added Developer Tools in the app settings, giving you more control and customization options.
>
> Thank you for being a part of the Cinny community. We’ve got even more updates coming soon! 🎉 Checkout [Github release](https://github.com/cinnyapp/cinny/releases/tag/v4.3.0) for more technical notes.

### Rory&::MatrixUtils - General utility suite for Matrix

[Emma [it/its]](https://matrix.to/#/@emma:rory.gay) announces

> Nothing too major, mostly just UX and performance updates :)
>
> Changes:
>
> * The membership history tool has been re-written! You can actually drill down to every single possible transition, while being generally faster.
> * Moving a window will no longer absolutely break down. Untested with touch screens, but it should work?
> * Better support for authenticated media - images flicker a lot less now, but is less reliable.
> * Made the homepage more reliable, hopefully? Misconfigured homeservers should no longer throw internal exceptions.
> * Logs will no longer be spammed when a tool is fetching the current session.
> * Added some logic to warn about room versions with low server support (ie. v1-v6), to encourage room admins to upgrade their rooms to maximise server support (/me looks at conduit/+derivatives)
> * Optimised some uncommon tools that haven't seen updates in ages.
> * Fixed some long outstanding issues, such as the navigation bar link to git.
>
>
> The "first party" instance is available at <https://mru.rory.gay>, and is a clientside-only web app!
>
> ***And, as with all of the other projects:***
>
> * The code is available at [cgit.rory.gay](https://cgit.rory.gay/matrix/tools/MatrixUtils.git/)!
>     * All contributions are more than welcome, be it documentation, code, layout/UI/UX improvements, anything!
> * Discussion, suggestions and ideas are welcome in [#mru:rory.gay](https://matrix.to/#/#mru:rory.gay)

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰

### Matrix Rust SDK ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk))

Next-gen crypto-included SDK for developing Clients, Bots and Appservices; written in Rust with bindings for Node, Swift and WASM

[poljar](https://matrix.to/#/@poljar:matrix.org) reports

> Last week, we released Matrix Rust SDK 0.10.0, marking the final version that
> includes support for [MSC3575](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3575).
>
> On the development side, we're making the event cache, including offline
> storage, more functional and ready for use. For those unfamiliar, the event
> cache plays a crucial role in managing all events received by a room. It
> constructs a high-level model of the room, which the timeline then uses to
> render an accurate view.
>
> #### Recent changes to the event cache
>
> * Add a new benchmark to measure the time to fill a timeline with many events ([#4668](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4668))
> * Introduced `EventCacheStore::filter_duplicated_events` ([#4659](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4659))
> * Extract the deduplication of events out of `RoomEvents` ([#4656](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4656))
> * Handle more timeline item content kinds in replied-to details ([#4649](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4649))
> * Simplify the transition from an unencrypted event to encrypted ([#4630](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4630))
> * Maintain aggregations when an event is deduplicated ([#4576](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4576))
>
> #### Authentication system improvements
>
> * Only support public clients when authenticating ([#4634](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4634))
> * Switched from openidconnect to the oauth2 crate ([#4604](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4604))
> * Removed unnecessary E2EE imports in the OIDC submodule ([#4553](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4553))
>
> #### Other notable updates
>
> * Enforced TLS 1.2 or newer for all HTTP requests ([#4647](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4647))
> * Allow fetching encryption info using session ID ([#4658](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4658))
> * Ensured known secrets are deleted from 4S when recovery is disabled ([#4629](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4629))

## Dept of Services 🚀

### 🎉 Today marks 4 years of etke.cc! 🎉 ([website](https://etke.cc))

Your matrix server on your conditions

[Slavi](https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:etke.cc) reports

> The etke.cc managed Matrix hosting service was launched on the 12th of February 2021 and has turned 4 years old today!
>
> Below is an overview of improvements that have happened over the last year.
>
> #### Component changes
>
> In the past year, we have launched a smaller number of components compared to [last year](https://etke.cc/news/kyn2o2hccqnb0yfgv2zmmm5wdv-s2j8xwtze6u5wf0c/). Most of our effort was spent on improving existing components, keeping up with upstream bridge replacements and polishing our service.
>
> These components can be installed on existing servers upon request through our [contact page](https://etke.cc/contacts/).
>
> ##### Matrix-related components
>
> * ✨ **Addition**: ($3/mo) [maubot](https://etke.cc/help/bots/maubot/) - a plugin-based Matrix bot system offering a wide range of [plugins](https://plugins.mau.bot/)
> * 🚀 **Replacement/Upgrade**: (+$3/mo) [baibot](https://etke.cc/help/bots/baibot/) - a Large-Language-Model (LLM) bot developed by us as a replacement for our old [ChatGPT bot](https://etke.cc/help/bots/chatgpt/) offering. You can use it to communicate with [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)'s [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt) and [various other LLM providers](https://github.com/etkecc/baibot/blob/main/docs/providers.md).
> * 🔄 **Replacement**: the old [mautrix-facebook](https://github.com/mautrix/facebook) bridge was superseded by the new [mautrix-meta](https://github.com/mautrix/meta) bridge for bridging to [Messenger](https://www.messenger.com/). See [our docs here](https://etke.cc/help/bridges/mautrix-meta-messenger/).
> * 🔄 **Replacement**: the old [mautrix-instagram](https://github.com/mautrix/instagram) bridge was superseded by the new [mautrix-meta](https://github.com/mautrix/meta) bridge for bridging to [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/). See [our docs here](https://etke.cc/help/bridges/mautrix-meta-instagram/).
> * 🔄 **Replacement**: `mx-puppet-discord` was removed, in favor of the better [mautrix-discord](https://etke.cc/help/bridges/mautrix-discord/) bridge we've been offering already
> * 🔄 **Replacement**: `mx-puppet-slack` was removed, in favor of the better [mautrix-slack](https://etke.cc/help/bridges/mautrix-slack/) bridge we've been offering already
> * 🔄 **Replacement**: `appservice-webhooks` was removed, in favor of the better [Hookshot](https://etke.cc/help/bridges/hookshot/) bridge we've been offering already
> * 🔄 **Replacement**: `wireguard+dnsmasq` was removed, in favor of the better [Firezone](https://etke.cc/help/extras/firezone) VPN solution we've been offering already
> * 🗑️ **Removal**: The following components were removed: `mx-puppet-steam`, `mx-puppet-groupme`, `dimension`. We removed them because they were not maintained upstream. Unfortunately, there's no alternative right now.
>
> ##### Non-Matrix-related components
>
> * ✨ **Addition**: (+$1/mo) \[previously-offered and making a comeback\] the [LanguageTool](https://etke.cc/help/extras/languagetool/) proofreading software, now with optional n-grams support
> * ✨ **Addition**: (+$5/mo) \[brand new\] the [Funkwhale](https://etke.cc/help/extras/funkwhale/) decentralized audio hosting platform
> * ✨ **Addition**: (+$5/mo) \[brand new\] the [PeerTube](https://etke.cc/help/extras/peertube/) decentralized video hosting platform
> * ☁️ **Upgrade**: (free) [S3 Object Storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_S3) support was added to [GoToSocial](https://etke.cc/help/extras/gotosocial/) to make local disk space less of a limiting factor when scaling up
> * 🔄 **Replacement**: We've replaced the [Redis](https://redis.io/) implementation twice, first with [KeyDB](https://keydb.dev/) and then with [Valkey](https://valkey.dev/) (which established itself as the leading and more compatible Redis implementation). Redis is an internal dependency component and only enabled on servers that need it.
>
> #### Other changes
>
> * ✨ **Addition**: A new [monitoring service](https://etke.cc/services/monitoring/) was created to monitor the health of each server and alert customers when troubles occur.
> * ✨ **Addition**: Our new [demo service](https://etke.cc/demo/) allows new and existing customers to test various components and features before ordering a Matrix server.
> * ✨ **Addition**: A new hosted version of the [synapse-admin](https://etke.cc/help/extras/synapse-admin/) software is now available at [admin.etke.cc](https://admin.etke.cc/). We still install synapse-admin to to each customer's server as well, but the hosted version is a more bleeding-edge alternative that contains yet-unreleased features.
> * ✨ **Addition**: [synapse-admin](https://etke.cc/help/extras/synapse-admin/) provides [exclusive features](https://etke.cc/help/extras/synapse-admin/#features) to etke.cc customers, which connect synapse-admin with etke.cc's [monitoring system](https://etke.cc/services/monitoring/) and [scheduler bot](https://etke.cc/help/extras/scheduler/).
> * 🚀 **Upgrade**: [HTTP/3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/3) support was added an enabled by default to all Matrix and non-Matrix services
> * 🚀 **Upgrade**: Our [private Docker registry](https://etke.cc/services/registry/) now supports caching and authentication via [docker-registry-proxy](https://github.com/etkecc/docker-registry-proxy)
> * 📈 **Upgrade**: Thanks to our new monitoring service, some customers (those packing too many services on a small VPS) became aware of high RAM utilization. As a result we've adjusted database tuning to lower RAM cap and made SWAP more aggressive.
> * 📨 **Upgrade**: Overdue payments alerts are now delivered both to Matrix and email, ensuring important notifications are not missed.
> * 📨 **Upgrade**: DKIM support was added to the mailing service (`exim-relay`) used by all components, to improve email deliverability when the Matrix server sends outgoing emails. Last year, we added DKIM support to the [Postmoogle](https://etke.cc/help/bridges/postmoogle/) email bridge so this is a continuation of that effort.
> * 🆘 **Upgrade**: We've migrated our customer support system from Matrix (powered by [Honoroit](https://etke.cc/help/bots/honoroit/) and [Postmoogle](https://etke.cc/help/bridges/postmoogle/)) to [Freescout](https://freescout.net/) (self-hosted via our own [mash-playbook](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook)). Using a dedicated customer support system has proven to be more manageable compared to dealing with chat threads in Matrix.
> * 🆘 **Upgrade**: New [orders](https://etke.cc/order/) are now followed by an Order Status page that simplifies the completion process. It contains instructions for next steps regarding DNS settings and other configuration requirements.
> * 🆘 **Upgrade**: The [scheduler bot](https://etke.cc/help/extras/scheduler/) now supports a new [`price` command](https://etke.cc/help/extras/scheduler/#price), which provides an overview of server costs with detailed breakdown by components
> * 🧑 **Upgrade**: We have finally added an [About](https://etke.cc/about/) page to our website. Thankfully, it took us less than 4 years to get to it.
>
> #### Free-software work
>
> We've continued our work on the free-software (AGPLv3) Ansible mega-playbook - [mash-playbook](https://github.com/mother-of-all-self-hosting/mash-playbook), which has grown to include 110+ components.
>
> As part of our work over the past year, we have also developed and released as free-software (AGPLv3) the following new tools:
>
> * ✨ **Brand New**: [baibot](https://gitlab.com/etke.cc/baibot) - a Large-Language-Model (LLM) bot that you can talk to via Matrix, based on [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)'s [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt) or other LLM providers. This new bot is available to etke.cc customers, as mentioned above.
> * ✨ **Brand New**: [Docker Registry Proxy](https://github.com/etkecc/docker-registry-proxy) - a caching and authentication proxy for Docker registries
> * ✨ **Brand New**: [Synapse User Auto Eraser](https://github.com/etkecc/synapse-user-autoerase) - tool for automatically erasing users and their media using Synapse Admin API. This is used internally in our new demo service to keep the server small and clean. See the [Other changes](#other-changes) section for more details.
> * 🔀 **Fork**: [etkecc/synapse-admin](https://github.com/etkecc/synapse-admin) - we forked [original synapse-admin software](https://github.com/Awesome-Technologies/synapse-admin) (created by [Awesome Technologies](https://awesome-technologies.de/en)) to implement often requested Quality-Of-Life changes - see the [highlights](https://github.com/etkecc/synapse-admin/?tab=readme-ov-file#changes). We've made 37 releases already.
>
> We've also done a lot more. Keep an eye on [our GitHub](https://github.com/etkecc) for more.
>
> #### Numbers
>
> * 🏗️ We've **installed 700+ Matrix servers** in total, out of which **250 new ones**.
> * 🔄 **Pushed 391 updates and enhancements** to the automation framework used as the service core (this does not count the number of updates to the components and upstream projects themselves).
> * 📢 **Posted 56 updates** in the announcements room, so you're always up-to-date with what we're working on.
