## Dept of Clients 📱

### Element X iOS ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios))

A total rewrite of Element-iOS using the Matrix Rust SDK underneath and targeting devices running iOS 16+.

[Mauro Romito](https://matrix.to/#/@mauro.romito:element.io) says

> * Knocking , alongside security and privacy settings work is almost completed, recently a testing session was done, where we determined that the features work well, and require only some small polishing before release
> * Media gallery also received a lot of improvements and updates and is being closer to get completed
> * Today we release our first RC with calendar versioning, which will soon become the new standard for marking releases
> * Some small design improvements were made for the DM Details view
> * Alongside some improvements for the macOS version

### Element X Android ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-android))

Android Matrix messenger application using the Matrix Rust SDK and Jetpack Compose.

[benoit](https://matrix.to/#/@benoit.marty:matrix.org) reports

> * Knocking , alongside security and privacy settings work is almost completed, recently a testing session was done, where we determined that the features work well, and require only some small polishing before release (yes, I have shamefully copied what Mauro said about EXI 🙈)
> * It will be possible to swipe between media when open from the timeline in the next release. Previously it was only possible to scipe when the media was opened from the gallery.
> * Next release will be versioned using calendar versioning, so that it will be easier to know the release date and also how old is a particular release just by knowing its version. Also iOS and Android will share the same version!

### Tammy ([website](https://tammy.connect2x.de))

Multiplatform messengers build on top of Trixnity Messenger

[Benedict](https://matrix.to/#/@benedict:imbitbu.de) reports

> Tammy just got a new release! This update brings speed boosts, fresh features, and tons of fixes to make your messaging experience smoother than ever.
> 
> ✨ What’s New?
> * **Typing indicators** in the room list – see who’s responding in real time!
> * **A sleek new image details view** for a better media experience.
> * **Send attachments with Enter** for quicker sharing on Desktop.
> * **Under-the-hood improvements** to make Tammy even faster and more reliable.
> 
> ⚠️ **Heads-up!** We had to change the database, so you’ll need to log in again. Should we ever have more Tammy users and this happens again, we will do an automatic migration. It's just not worth it at the moment.
> 
> Checkout the new Tammy version at https://tammy.connect2x.de and give us feedback in https://matrix.to/#/#tammy:imbitbu.de 🚀

## Dept of VoIP 🤙

### Element call on Room Kit (Cisco) devices

[Emma [it/its]](https://matrix.to/#/@emma:rory.gay) reports

> You may or may not have seen my demo at FOSDEM last saturday.
> In short, I've been working with Robert on integrating Element Call into the closed garden ecosystem of Cisco's meeting devices. This gives businesses and government agencies a migration flow to Matrix, without having to spend a large amount of money on new hardware - by meeting them where they are at.
> 
> In the current state of things, we're able to join a call, but dont yet have any interface for interacting with
>  the call once it's running, but it's a great start!
> 
> If you're interested, join us in [#roomos-matrixrtc:rory.gay](https://matrix.to/#/#roomos-matrixrtc:rory.gay), though we do hang out in [#webrtc:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#webrtc:matrix.org) quite regularly aswell!

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰

### Trixnity ([website](https://gitlab.com/trixnity/trixnity))

Multiplatform Kotlin SDK for developing Clients, Bots, Appservices and Servers

[Benedict](https://matrix.to/#/@benedict:imbitbu.de) reports

> A new version of Trixnity is out! The release brings massive performance enhancements to Trixnity, significantly improving sync processing efficiency. Processing times have been boosted by up to 5x, while RAM usage has been slashed by the same factor. These improvements were achieved by optimizing how the cache interacts with the local database—bypassing the cache entirely when no listeners are active. On top of this, the cache now supports rollbacks, which helps maintain consistency between the cache and the database, even in edge cases.
> 
> A noteworthy change in this release is the removal of support for the Realm database. As Realm-Kotlin is no longer actively maintained or compatible with the latest Kotlin versions, we’ve decided to discontinue its support. However, there’s good news! The Androidx Room database implementation has been fixed and is now a solid alternative for those seeking a reliable, cross-platform database solution.
> 
> In addition to these major updates, the release includes several smaller but impactful improvements and bug fixes. For example, refresh token support has been added. Be sure to check out the full changelog for all the details.

## Dept of Bots 🤖

### Draupnir ([website](https://github.com/the-draupnir-project/Draupnir))

A moderation bot for open Matrix communities

[Gnuxie 💜🐝](https://matrix.to/#/@gnu_ponut:matrix.org) announces

> We have released [Draupnir](https://github.com/the-draupnir-project/Draupnir) [v2.1.0](https://github.com/the-draupnir-project/Draupnir/releases/tag/v2.1.0) with some bug fixes in the wake of the v2.0.2 release:
> 
> * Some moderators noticed that on upgrading from `v1.87.0` to `v2.0.*` some rooms would appear unprotected. It later turned out that the functionality for the config option `protectAllJoinedRooms` was missing from this release. We've now fixed this and also updated the `!draupnir rooms` command to show which rooms Draupnir is and isn't protecting. Your rooms should be automatically protected again on upgrading to `v2.1.0`.
> 
> * The config option ` commands.allowNoPrefix` has been fixed again. Some commands would interact badly with the setting in the `v2.0.*` releases, this has now been fixed.
> 
> * Functionality has been added in conjunction with `protectAllJoinedRooms` to automatically unprotect rooms that it has been kicked from and notify the management room.
> 
> A couple other issues have been fixed around Draupnir startup time, and manually entering safe mode, so checkout the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/the-draupnir-project/Draupnir/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v210---2025-02-02) if you are interested in those. As always you can find us in [#draupnir:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#draupnir:matrix.org). Thank you to everyone who has been promptly reporting bugs and making these fixes possible <3

### Matrix Spec for Dash & Zeal: Looking for help

[Christian Paul (jaller94)](https://matrix.to/#/@jaller94:matrix.org) announces

> Hi everyone,
> for the past 2.5 years I've submitted new versions of the Matrix Spec to Dash and Zeal. Dash is a documentation browser which works offline. Zeal is an open source browser supporting the same docset format.
> 
> The Matrix Spec is built with Hugo and in v1.13 the Hugo config changed enough to break my build script. Currently, I'm unable to release new docsets as these require relative URLs in all HTML files.
> 
> Is anyone using this docset?
> Can someone help to maintain this or figure out the changes needed for v1.13?
