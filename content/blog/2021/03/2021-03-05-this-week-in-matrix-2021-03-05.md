### matrix-media-repo

[matrix-media-repo](https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo) is a highly customizable multi-domain media repository for Matrix

[TravisR](https://github.com/turt2live) told us:

> v1.2.3 is out now with a highish priority fix if you have audio thumbnails enabled. Other goodies include an `X-Robots-Tag` header and some artifact repairs on gif and apng thumbnails. See https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo/releases/tag/v1.2.3 for the full changelog.

### Dendrite / gomatrixserverlib

Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go

[Neil Alexander](https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org) said:

> Earlier this week we released [Dendrite 0.3.11](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.3.11), and since then we have merged a significant number of appservice fixes to `master` which will go into the next release. With these, bridges should stand a much better chance of working with Dendrite.
>
> Changes include:
>
> * Events are now properly sent to interested appservices
>
> * Appservice namespace exclusivity is now respected properly
> * Users starting with `_` can now be registered by appservices correctly
>
> * Room alias queries for appservices have been improved and should work now
>
> We also upgraded a number of dependencies.
>
> Spec compliance has improved slightly:
>
> * Client-server APIs: 60%, up from 56% last week
>
> * Server-server APIs: 82%, up from 80% last week
>
> As always, please feel free to join us in [#dendrite:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org) for general Dendrite chat, and [#dendrite-dev:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite-dev:matrix.org) if you are interested in contributing!

Spec compliance is really progressing!

### Synapse

Synapse is a popular homeserver written in Python.

[callahad](https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org) told us:

> We've heard some feedback that Synapse's release cadence—an RC every other week, with releases in between—can feel a bit overwhelming. In response, I'm going to try to write a little less about each RC and instead simply refer to the [1.29.0rc1 Release Notes](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.29.0rc1) from yesterday.
>
> We'll shout a bit more when that matures into a formal release early next week. 🙂
>
> On non-release weeks I'll try to spend a little more time focusing on the behind-the-scenes aspects of developing Synapse in our TWiM updates. If there's anything in particular you'd like hear about, let me know!
>
> Speaking of, we're experimenting with using GitHub Discussions for... discussions.
>
> We don't want to go full-on mailing list, but it might be nice to have a place to for slower, asynchronous conversations that don't quite fit into the more rapid pace of a typical Matrix room.
>
> Our first two discussion topics ask about:
>
> * [Your experiences with GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/discussions/9553)
>
> * [How Synapse could be better](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/discussions/9554)
>
> Please do weigh in!

## Dept of Bridges 🌉

### GroupMe bridge (matrix-groupme-go)

[karmanyaahm](https://matrix.to/#/@karmanyaah:malhotra.cc) offered:

> I'm working on a GroupMe bridge I made based on tulir's mautrix-whatsapp and mautrix-go.
>
> I aim to add features like double puppeting, end to bridge encryption, etc over time, but an alpha release is available now. I would love to get bug reports and testing info to fix them.
>
> If anyone's running/testing this please join [#groupme-go-bridge:malhotra.cc](https://matrix.to/#/#groupme-go-bridge:malhotra.cc) to chat about it
>
> https://github.com/karmanyaahm/matrix-groupme-go

Another recent GroupMe bridge effort: https://gitlab.com/robintown/mx-puppet-groupme

### matrix-appservice-bridge v2.6.0-rc1

[Half-Shot](https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk) announced:

> A PSA this time around. Please test this release and update as soon as you can when we go to release on Monday next week. We've included a change to correct how users are registered against the homeserver to comply with the spec (Synapse accepts a /register call without a `type=m.login.application`, and versions 2.5.0 and below of the matrix-appservice-bridge sent these invalid requests). I'm hoping to eventually retire this behaviour from Synapse, so the more people that upgrade the better!
>
> Also [this PR](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9548) is the Synapse-side change to remove this behaviour. If your appservice implementation uses this behaviour, **please** chime in.



### matrix-appservice-irc hits v0.25.0(-rc1)

[Half-Shot](https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk) told us:

> Hey folks, [this release](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/0.25.0-rc1) contains a bunch of tiny-but-useful bugfixes that you'd hate to miss out on. The full release comes next week but if you want to help us test early, come and get it while it's hot! This release includes the all important fixes from matrix-appservice-bridge v2.6.0-rc1 which fix a spec compliance issue.

## Dept of Clients 📱

### Hydrogen

A minimal Matrix chat client, focused on performance, offline functionality, and broad browser support. https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web/

[Bruno](https://matrix.to/#/@bwindels:matrix.org) said:

> Multiple releases this week with lots of bug fixes:
>
>  * make catchup sync faster, a fix for the biggest slowdown
>  * correct profile info on messages during sending
>
>  * messages don't wait for remote echo to be marked as sent
>  * make storage on iOS more reliable, this should hopefully be the last of storage errors on this platform
>
>  * fix file up/downloads on iOS
>  * fixed an issue where room keys never got shared if you talk into an e2ee room for the very first time since login and you happen to be offline
>
>  * more little fixes.
>
> Fixes, fixes, fixes. Working on another catchup sync slowdown, and then hope to focus soon a new features!

### Element Web on IPFS

[TR_SLimey](https://matrix.to/#/@tr_slimey:an-atom-in.space) reported:

> I mentioned a while back that I've put Element Web on IPFS.
>
> Since then, I unfortunately had to change its DNSLink domain, so I decided to post about it again, with the new addresses and some minor updates. Here are the former:
>
> * `ipns://element-web.0x1a8510f2.space/` (Main DNSLink address)
>
> * `ipns://k2k4r8mx8muu913j5oy3e4zvt77xtks8xgxuamlv0ltzwx95lcgk2glw` (IPNS hash which the above address points to)
> * `ipfs://bafybeievxs6qzzbfbn6xcbz3xwxhjzxkffjbpwbcc3gikrac6ytqkkutva` (IPFS hash of the current snapshot of the above)
>
> In other news, I've updated Element on IPFS to v1.7.22 and made a tiny script to easily update it in future. In case it's of use to anyone, it's right here:
>
> ```
>
> #!/bin/bash
>
> if [ "$#" -ne 2 ]; then
>
>         echo -e "Invalid number of arguments (got $# but 2 required)!\nUsage: $0 <element web folder> <release tag to download>" >&2
>         exit 1
>
> fi
>
> wget -c "https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/releases/download/$2/element-$2.tar.gz" -O - | tar --overwrite --strip-components=1 -xzv -C $1 element-$2
>
> ipfs add -r -p $1
>
> echo "Now use: 'ipfs name publish -key=<publish key> <folder ID>' to publish on IPFS"
> ```

### NeoChat

[Carl Schwan](https://matrix.to/#/@carl:kde.org) announced:

> We are currently refactoring the NeoChat room page. Nothing merged yet but scrolling is now smoother, we added swipe gestures to reply on mobile, and more importantly chat bubbles are coming :) Here is a small video of the new timeline, feedback very much welcome.

### #matrix-admins-edu-german:matrix.org

[Marcus Schopen](https://matrix.to/#/@mschopen:uni-bielefeld.de) (the fellow with the [festive mugs](https://matrix.org/blog/2020/12/11/this-week-in-matrix-2020-12-11#dept-of-status-of-matrix-%EF%B8%8F)) reported:

> Together with Anthony Rhode from Element we have published the room [#matrix-admins-edu-german:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-admins-edu-german:matrix.org) for Matrix Admins at German-speaking educational institutions. Here we want to discuss topics about Matrix in an academic context. The room is open to the public and everyone is very welcome.

How is it not `#matrix-admins-edu-deutsche:matrix.org`!? This is a welcome public room for the growing number of Matrix Admins in Germany!

## Dept of Interesting Projects 🛰️

### Cactus Comments

[carl](https://matrix.to/#/@carl:bordum.dk) announced:

> I am very excited to launch Cactus Comments (https://cactus.chat) today together with @asbjorn:olli.ng!
>
> Cactus Comments is a federated, web-embeddable comment system. And of course, we federate by building on Matrix!
>
> On the frontend - your website - we embed a Matrix client written in Elm that renders Matrix rooms as comment sections. The client is designed to be especially easy to embed on static sites. Once you log in to the client, it will only communicate directly with your Matrix server of choice.
>
> On the backend, an application service is used to create rooms on-demand and help with moderation. It is built with Python and is completely stateless. It does this by modelling all state in native Matrix objects without any custom events!
>
> The entire thing is free and open source software and we would love it if you were to contribute. We really hope some of you will give it a try!
>
> Join our matrix room: [#cactus:cactus.chat](https://matrix.to/#/#cactus:cactus.chat)
>
> Read the introductory blog post: https://cactus.chat/blog/hello-cactus-comments/
> Try the demo: https://cactus.chat/demo/
>
> Source code: https://gitlab.com/cactus-comments

What a project! Let's see how we can integrate this with the Matrix.org blog!

### Matrix Queue Processor

[reivilibre](https://matrix.to/#/@reivilibre:librepush.net) reported:

> With things on the Internet vanishing, I've been wanting to start saving copies of interesting web pages and videos to my server-at-home.
>
> This really doesn't involve much more than just running `youtube-dl` or `archivebox` on the relevant URLs, but I needed a better way than having to e-mail myself reminders to download things…
>
> I decided to make [Matrix Queue Processor](https://bics.ga/reivilibre/matrix_queue_proc).
>
> You can run it occasionally (or set it up to run in a cron job!) and it will then read all outstanding messages and feed the text to a given command, such as `youtube-dl`.
>
> You can choose for it to delete processed messages, or tick them off (✅). If the command wasn't successful, it will instead reply with the exit code.
>
> It's not particularly sophisticated but it might at least be a small starting point for anyone who wanted to make something similar, and it is end-to-end encryption capable because it uses the Python `matrix-nio` SDK.
>
> See this example of use with `youtube-dl`; it fails on the second message because it's not a video page URL:

I like this a lot - there are so many uses for this project.
