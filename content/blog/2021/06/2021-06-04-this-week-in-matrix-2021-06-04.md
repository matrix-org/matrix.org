### Wired UK feature article

Wired UK have published a feature on Matrix in their print edition this month. We'll be sure to link to it when it's made available online!

### German-universities poll

[jfkimmes](https://matrix.to/#/@jfkimmes:matrix.org) shared:

> I just learned that in a poll of 89 universities in Germany, Matrix ranked third place in the chat category already. 
>
> The source is in only available in German, unfortunately: https://zenodo.org/record/4817795
>
> However, the conclusion list (first table) may be understandable from context. It lists the top three solutions per category with their respective number of universities using it.


[Oleg](https://matrix.to/#/@oleg:fiksel.info) clarified:

> The evaluation was "which solution are you using".

[Florian](https://matrix.to/#/@florian:dsn.tm.kit.edu) added:

> The Instant Messaging part starts at slide 15, the first chart on that slide is "which solution do you use", the second is "How content are you with the solution?", with Matrix having the best average of all solutions, namely ~8.8/10.

also [JCG](https://matrix.to/#/@jan.christian:gruenhage.xyz):

> What's also noteworthy: Those using matrix are the happiest with the solution

## Dept of Spec 📜

### Spec

[anoa](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz) offered:

> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals.
>
>
> #### MSC Status
>
> **New MSCs:**
>
> * [MSC3231: Token authenticated registration](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3231)
> * [MSC3230: Spaces top level order](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3230)
>
> * [MSC3226: Per-room spell check](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3226)
>
> **MSCs with proposed Final Comment Period:**
>
> * *No MSCs entered proposed FCP state this week.*
>
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
>
> * *No MSCs are in FCP.*
>
> **Merged MSCs:**
>
> * *No MSCs were merged this week.*
>
> #### Spec Updates
>
> This week the Spec Core Team has been reviewing various Spaces MSCs, most recently [MSC3230](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3230) (Space ordering). We're also hoping to square away the [aggregations MSCs](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1849#issuecomment-655153491) (message editing, reactions, etc) once and for all, though this will likely take a concerted effort from a few members to pull off.
>
> Finally [MSC3231](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3231) is a (currently draft status) MSC from Callum, one of Matrix.org's [GSoC students](https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/20/google-summer-of-code-2021) this year! His project aims to allow native token-based registration to homeservers (the idea is so that you can generate a few tokens from your registration-disabled homeserver and hand them out to a few trusted friends and family members).
>
> And finally, work still continues on finishing up the technical portions of the new release process for the spec. As mentioned last week, we've attempted to split the work up over multiple people in order to get it done quicker. Slowly but surely...

## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Synapse

Synapse is a popular homeserver written in Python.

[callahad](https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org) said:

> Hello from the Synapse team! A short update for a short workweek (thanks, bank holidays!):
>
> * Synapse 1.35 [was released](https://matrix.org/blog/2021/06/01/synapse-1-35-0-released) this week! The Spaces flag is on by default, a bunch of bugs were fixed, and we've landed many of the prerequisites to eliminating RAM spikes on room joins.
>
> * 📚 We have new docs! 📚 Anoa converted our docs to build with mdbook ([#10086](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10086)), and you can now browse them at https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/! Check it out and let us know what you think. (Note: Not all of the pages have been converted from reStructuredText to Markdown yet, so some might render a bit strangely, but the structure is there!)
>
> Catch you next Friday! 👋

### synapse-media-proxy

[f0x](https://matrix.to/#/@f0x:pixie.town) announced:

> Another round of updates on my smart caching media proxy. After refactoring a lot (as always), I implemented **thumbnailing**! Now the only big feature left to add is url previewing.
> I also have a test deployment configured on media.pixie.town now, so you can try fetching a bit of remote media through there, or view [this submissions screenshot](https://media.pixie.town/_matrix/media/r0/download/media.pixie.town/GLhyjFL8MPAzz5Oh1gIzF3lQ)
>
> #### metrics
>
> Got started implementing a Prometeus /metrics endpoint, with a [rudimentary Grafana dashboard](https://stats.pixie.town/d/rPBvoh6Gk/synapse-media-proxy?orgId=1) for my test installation. 
>
> #### comparison with [matrix-media-repo](https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo/)
>
> While they both implement Matrix' media endpoints, they serve rather different niches, where matrix-media-repo fully decouples the media repo aspect, my proxy cooperates with Synapse's filesystem and database, to speed up operation while ultimately making it a seamless drop-in and removal process.
>
> [also](https://media.pixie.town/_matrix/media/r0/download/im_a/teapot) :P

## Homeserver Deployment 📥️

### Kubernetes

[Ananace](https://matrix.to/#/@ace:kittenface.studio) offered:

> And another weekly installment of Kubernetes [Helm Chart](https://gitlab.com/ananace/charts) (and deprecated [Docker image](https://github.com/ananace/matrix-synapse)) updates, tracking the Synapse releases this week (1.35.0/1).

## Dept of Bridges 🌉

### Heisenbridge demo video

[hifi](https://matrix.to/#/@hifi:vi.fi) shared this great demonstation video of [Heisenbridge](https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/):

{{ youtube_player(video_id="nQk1Bp4tk4I") }}

[Half-Shot](https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk) hit us late with a pair of updates:

### Security release for the matrix-appservice-irc and matrix-appservice-bridge library

> Hello. This week we've released an update to the https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/ library containing a security fix for room upgrade handling. The security report will come later, but for now we advise anyone using the room upgrade handler feature to upgrade to [2.6.1](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/releases/tag/2.6.1). By the same token, we would also advise _all_ IRC bridge admins to update their bridge to [0.26.1](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/releases/tag/0.26.1).

### The Libera.chat bridge is still ongoing

> Howdy folks. As you've likely seen over the last few days, we're still hard at work getting the final pegs in place for the libera.chat bridge. As usual, you can start using the bridge now while it's in beta by going to `#<foo>:libera.chat`, but we're hoping to have the thing stable by next week. Catch us in #libera-matrix:libera.chat for the juicy gossip about it.

### matrix-puppeteer-line

[Fair](https://matrix.to/#/@fair:miscworks.net) reported:

[matrix-puppeteer-line](https://src.miscworks.net/fair/matrix-puppeteer-line): A bridge for LINE Messenger based on running LINE's Chrome extension in Puppeteer.

> * Send a bridge notice when getting unexpectedly logged out of LINE, to warn you to log in again.
> * Improve resiliency of LINE user avatar syncing.
> * Properly support syncing LINE rooms with participants who aren't in your LINE friends list (This was harder than it sounds...!)
> 
> These changes (and ones before it) will be merged to `master` once I reorganize some messy commits.
> 
> The next big task is still to fix outbound read receipts (i.e. to make it so that the bridge syncing a message doesn't make your > LINE contacts think you actually read that message). Once that is done, I'll consider the bridge to be in beta.
>

## Dept of Clients 📱

### Thunderbird Matrix support

[freaktechnik](https://matrix.to/#/@freaktechnik:humanoids.be) announced:

> [Thunderbird](https://thunderbird.net) now has Matrix support based on `matrix-js-sdk` enabled in the Nightly builds.
>
> The star feature is probably that we support multiple Matrix accounts in the same client. Right now all your unencrypted rooms with text messages should work fine. While we think we won't destroy your account's state, it's still recommended to use a testing account with it. During account setup, it will ask you for a password, even if the homeserver supports SSO. If you intend to log in through SSO, just leave the password field blank.
>
> We're not quite at the point where we support all the things you love about chatting with Matrix. Many of the missing features and polish to make communication successful are tracked in [this meta bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1712710). The goal for that milestone is to enable Matrix in our Beta builds.
>
> You can get a Thunderbird Nightly build at the bottom of [thunderbird.net](https://thunderbird.net/#channel) by switching from "Beta Channel" to "Nightly Channel". If you run into bugs with the Matrix integration, please report them through [this form](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Chat%20Core&component=Matrix). When filing a bug, please include debug logs. You can copy the debug logs for the account by going to the "Show Accounts" dialog, right clicking the account and selecting "Copy Debug Log". Note that the debug log may contain information from any of your conversations, so you might want to check the contents before posting it anywhere.

Also, check out Matrix Live!

### NeoChat

[Carl Schwan](https://matrix.to/#/@carl:kde.org) announced:

> NeoChat 1.2, our third major release, was released this week bringing many improvements to the timeline and text input component. If you missed it, you can read the announcement here: https://carlschwan.eu/2021/06/01/neochat-1.2-bubbles-better-text-editing-and-more/ and we even have a nice release video :) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lcH4tm6uTk 

{{ youtube_player(video_id="4lcH4tm6uTk") }}

> Other than that, we started working on an integration with KDE web shortcuts functionality to quickly search selected text on the web: https://invent.kde.org/network/neochat/-/merge_requests/279.



![2021-06-04-KGrID-image.png](/blog/img/2021-06-04-KGrID-image.png)

### Nheko

[Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)](https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev) told us:

> Callum, our GSoC student, after spending some time on Synapse, had now his first go at Nheko's codebase. He implemented, that you can now just enter the server name on registration instead of the full URL. This means entering conduit.rs or matrix.org works now nicely, since those servers are actually hosted at a different URL. He's now working on the Token Registration MSC, which he will implement in Synapse and Nheko, so exciting times ahead!
>
> We also had a small contribution from pcworld, who fixed that if you only viewed the room list in the narrow layout, you would not get notifications for the last selected room.
>
> I'll leave you with some words, that you may have heard a few times already: "Watch this space for next weeks update!"

### Fractal

[Alexandre Franke](https://matrix.to/#/@afranke:matrix.org) reported:

> A dozen merge requests have been integrated in our fractal-next branch since [last week](https://matrix.org/blog/2021/05/28/this-week-in-matrix-2021-05-28#fractal-updates).
>
> Amongst the more trivial changes, Julian made sure rooms are added to the sidebar in batch ([!737](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/737)) to improve performances, added in-app notifications for invite errors ([!760](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/760)), added a menu entry to leave rooms ([!769](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/769)), and implemented display of user and room avatars ([!770](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/770)). We also gained a right-click-menu entry to display event sources thanks to Kévin ([!766](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/766)).

## Dept of Events and Talks 🗣️

### Matrix @ FrOSCon this year

[Oleg](https://matrix.to/#/@oleg:fiksel.info) said:

> On **August 21-22** the annual **Fr**ee and **O**pen **S**ource **Con**ference (short [FrOSCon](https://www.froscon.de/)) will take place. Usually the conference takes place in a German University of applied Sciences Bonn Rhine Sieg. This year it will be virtual. On the positive side - we don't need to travel.

### Circles

[cvwright](https://matrix.to/#/@cvwright:matrix.org) reported:

> * Set up a new (virtual) EU homeserver in Frankfurt, so European folks can join the beta starting next week
>
> * Use StoreKit to detect when a user is in Europe and should therefore use the EU homeserver, both for GDPR and to minimize latency
> * Made some progress toward supporting `m.video` messages
>
> * Experimented with using the [new iOS photo picker](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10652/) to better protect users' privacy
