Friday already? Did this week already happen? It looked like the spacetime continuum was broken and we didn't know who did it. We needed witnesses to solve the case: did things really happen this week? And the witnesses showed up! A huge thanks to everyone in the Matrix community who reported their progress, and to everyone currently working on making awesome projects around Matrix!

The case is closed: the week has not been stolen from us. Time appears to have wings, and flies faster than we had anticipated.

## Matrix Live 🎙

{{ youtube_player(video_id="_G2z-LOhPjg") }}

A very very dense and exciting wrap up of what's happening these days in the Matrix space by Matrix Foundation co-founders Matthew & Amandine! Matrix is stepping up a gear with blazing fast Sync v3, Threading Support, VoIP, VR, a new release of the Spec, always more monthly active users, a full security audit and progress on P2P.

## Dept of Spec 📜

[anoa](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz) says

> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals>.
>
>
> ### MSC Status
>
> **New MSCs:**
>
> * [MSC3489: Sharing streams of location data](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3489)
> * [MSC3488: Extending events with location data](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3488)
>
> **MSCs with proposed Final Comment Period:**
>
> * *No MSCs entered proposed FCP state this week.*
>
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
>
> * [MSC2674: Event Relationships](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2674) (merge)
>
> **Merged MSCs:**
>
> * [MSC3283: Expose capabilities for profile actions](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3283)
>
> ### Spec Updates
>
> This week we finally, finally had one of the aggregation-related MSCs, [MSC2674](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2674) (event relationships) enter final comment period! This MSC, along with [several others](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1849#issue-406544216), document the stuff that powers message edit, reactions, the upcoming threading and polls MSCs, and much more! So it's really great to see the MSCs start to actually land.
>
> Speaking of threading [MSC3440](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3440) has had a good amount of review from the Spec Core Team last week. Threading in Matrix has been a long awaited feature for chat applications - as well as helping extend the flexibility of Matrix as a data structure even further. The MSC relies on both [MSC2674](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2674) and [MSC2675](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2675) (or a modified version of it), so the latter will be an area of focus for review for next week.
>
> ### Spec PRs
>
> It seems that the recent [Matrix v1.1](https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/09/matrix-v-1-1-release) has drummed up some more community support for spec PRs. Thank you to everyone who's sent in clarifications, changes and even typo fixes. In particular, [@ankur12-1610](https://github.com/ankur12-1610) for [fixes to the OpenAPI fields, and for typo corrections in the spec copy](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aankur12-1610), and [@Dominaezzz](https://github.com/Dominaezzz) for helping review them. Thank you both!
>
> ### Random Spec of the Week
>
> The random spec of the week is... [MSC2867: Marking rooms as unread](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2867)!
>
> This is definitely a feature that I would love to have for chat. Note that this MSC proposes marking *a room* as unread, rather than a specific point in the room's timeline. This is intentional as noted in the document, as the latter is more complicated, as it intersects with sending out read receipts to other users.

## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Synapse [↗](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/)

Synapse is the reference homeserver for Matrix

[dmr](https://matrix.to/#/@dmrobertson:matrix.org) announces

> **Note:** we plan to release a **security release, Synapse 1.47.1** on the coming **Tuesday, 23rd of November**; see the [predisclosure](https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/18/pre-disclosure-upcoming-security-release-of-synapse-1-47-1).
>
> We released Synapse 1.47.0 after squashing a couple of problems related to database migrations remaining in 1.47.0rc2.  Briefly, this release includes
>
> * new features for users of the [admin](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/administration/admin_api/index.html) and [module](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/modules/index.html) APIs;
> * a number of long-standing bug fixes, including a thorny bug which prevented joining certain old rooms; and
> * continuing efforts to prototype new MSCs and improve type coverage.
>
> The [blog post](https://matrix.org/blog/2021/11/17/synapse-1-47-0-released) has a better summary, and [GitHub](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.47.0) has the full gory details.
>
> We also released [Sydent 2.5.1](https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/releases/tag/v2.5.1), a minor release which improves the way we handle and log various error cases.
>
> Thank you as ever to our community contributors, and everyone out there who's using Synapse to communicate!

[dmr](https://matrix.to/#/@dmrobertson:matrix.org) also reminds us

> When we release the fix, the changes will be publicly known and bad actors will have the ability to deduce the vulnerability. Most servers don't run release candidates, so releasing the fix in an RC will mean there's a larger window for an attacker to exploit the problem. Internally, there will be an RC deployed to test homeservers and eventually matrix.org. This means we'll be able to confidently recommend the upgrade to server administrators.

[dkasak](https://matrix.to/#/@dkasak:termina.org.uk) adds

> And that's the very reason we have dedicated security releases, instead of just rolling the security fixes into a feature release. The security release doesn't contain anything new apart from the security fix so it minimizes the chance of things going wrong.

Keep your servers up to date, and your users safe, administrators!

## Homeserver Deployment 📥️

### Helm Chart [↗](https://gitlab.com/ananace/charts)

Matrix Kubernetes applications packaged into helm charts

[Ananace](https://matrix.to/#/@ace:kittenface.studio) says

> Would you believe it? This week has also seen updates to [my Helm Charts](https://gitlab.com/ananace/charts), with matrix-synapse having been updated to 1.47.0

## Dept of Bridges 🌉

### Heisenbridge [↗](https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/)

Heisenbridge is a bouncer-style Matrix IRC bridge.

[hifi](https://matrix.to/#/@hifi:vi.fi) says

> Release v1.7.0 🥳
>
> * Implement "best effort" basic IRC moderation in plumbed rooms if bot has ops on IRC
> * Allow configuring topic sync for plumbs (IRC<->Matrix or one way)
> * Allow using forward slash (/) as MXID separator for IRC ghosts
> * Bump max mautrix version to <0.12
> * Small fixes
>
> Plumb moderation! If the bridge bot has ops on IRC it will do its best to map kicks and bans (regarding IRC users) from Matrix. This definitely isn't perfect and is meant as a convenience.
>
> Topic synchronization is now configurable for plumbs as well to make it possible to share the same topic between an IRC channel and a plumbed Matrix room. Default is still off and it requires the bridge bot to have enough PL to work.
>
> The separator for IRC ghosts can now be changed to forward slash (/) from the default underscore (\_). This happens by modifying the regex in the registration file. Only do this for new installations and it will cause *all* IRC users to duplicate in rooms who you can't remove and probably other bad side effects as well. The default may be changed in the future.
>
> There were lots of refactoring issues so I hope I fixed all of them 🙈.
>
> Best effort your fix from [GitHub](https://github.com/hifi/heisenbridge/releases), [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/heisenbridge/) or [matrix-docker-ansible-deploy](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy)!
>
> Thanks!

Yet another week, yet another great update on Heisenbridge. At this rate Heisenbridge will reach perfection and hifi will run out of things to report!

>
> * New feature: if a user on your homeserver reports abuse, Mjölnir may now show the abuse report in your moderation room and offer you two-click moderation options. This feature is considered a preview for the time being.
> * Performance improvements for protections that need to lock back in the history of a room, decreasing the number of cases in which we could end up timing out.
> * Many improvements to testing.
>
> Note: Any rumor of a v1.2.0 Docker image borked by yours truly is sadly true. There should be no risk in 1.2.0 but, to be on the safe side, if you have updated to 1.2.0, please update to 1.2.1.

That's one feature I've wanted for a while, and it's going to make moderation a lot easier! Thanks Mjolnir teams for keeping us safe!

That's a fascinating client, it looks absolutely fantastic! It reminds me a little of [Cerrulean](https://github.com/matrix-org/cerulean). Good job Henri!

### Matrix Login

[Paul](https://matrix.to/#/@ptman:kapsi.fi) says
> There was the "Sign in with Matrix" project recently
>
> I tried to do something similar with <https://matrix-login.lyc.fi> / <https://gitlab.com/ptman/matrix-login>

An important note on the interesting projects using Matrix for the login: those are community projects, and there are MSCs in the works to "do it right" at the Spec level!

As Matthew Hodgson [reported in a comment on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29242445) :

> The direction we're headed in the Matrix spec core team is instead towards replacing Matrix's current auth mechanisms with normal Open ID Connect (rather than wrapping our own OIDC-like thing, as we do today) - as per <https://github.com/sandhose/matrix-doc/blob/msc/sandhose/oauth2-profile/proposals/2964-oauth2-profile.md> The common login flow would then be for users to be authed by their server using a trusted OIDC identity provider, rather than ever trusting arbitrary clients with their credentials.

## Dept of Guides 🧭

[Austin Huang](https://matrix.to/#/@austin:tchncs.de) announces

> I have compiled [a list of public homeservers](https://austinhuang.me/matrix-homeservers.html) available for registration, since previous such efforts to make these homeservers more discoverable fell through. This list serves as a sanitized version of the asra.gr list, with only homeservers intended for public consumption included. It is a static list and does not include pings, but rather than focusing on the technical aspect, my list has an emphasis on the written rules of a homeserver, which I believe to play a larger role in the Matrix experience. Hope this can spark other efforts in maintaining a better list!

That's one very useful list of hand curated servers! The transparency about the inclusion criteria is very much appreciated. Good job!
