### Decentralized Systems and Network Services Research Group output

[Florian](https://matrix.to/#/@florian:dsn.tm.kit.edu) told us:

> The article of my research group [Decentralized Systems and Network Services Research Group](https://dsn.kastel.kit.edu) from the [KASTEL Institute of Information Security and Dependability](https://kastel.kit.edu/) and me, [Analysis of the Matrix Event Graph Replicated Data Type](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3058576), was published in the Open Access journal [IEEE Access](https://ieeeaccess.ieee.org/)! 📰 🥳 Open Access here means that the article is freely available for you to read, under [CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

> In layman's terms, we showed that the Event Graph provides a strong form of eventual consistency even when new events are applied in arbitrary order. In addition, this consistency guarantee can still be provided even if all other servers in a room are malicious, which is unexpected compared to the honest majority required for the usual Distributed Ledger Technology. We also looked at the problem of “If servers randomly select at which parents at the bottom of the Event Graph they append new events, and the number of parents for an event is limited, how can you be sure that the Event Graph does not grow arbitrarily wide?“, which is something that puzzled me since the beginning of my Ph.D. two years ago. It is easy simulate a given setup and see that the width shrinks really fast, but it is also easy to see that arbitrary growth has a likelihood larger than zero. As this was astonishingly hard to grasp mathematically, we were very happy that we could recruit <a href="https://www.math.kit.edu/stoch/~henze/">Prof. Dr. Norbert Henze from the Institute of Stochastics</a> as co-author to provide evidence that you can expect the Event Graph to shrink to a normal width quite quickly.
>
> Let me quote parts of the abstract for some more technical details:
>
> > […] By comparison with traditional decentralized communication systems, Matrix replaces pure message passing with a replicated data structure. This data structure, which we extract and call the Matrix Event Graph (MEG), depicts the causal history of messages. We show that this MEG represents an interesting and important replicated data type for decentralized applications that are based on causal histories of publish-subscribe events: First, we prove that the MEG is a Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type for causal histories and, thus, provides Strong Eventual Consistency (SEC). With SEC being among the best known achievable trade-offs in the scope of the well-known CAP theorem, the MEG provides a powerful consistency guarantee while being available during network partition. Second, we discuss the implications of byzantine attackers on the data type’s properties. We note that the MEG, as it does not strive for consensus or strong consistency, can cope with n > f environments with n participants, of which f are byzantine. Furthermore, we analyze scalability: Using Markov chains, we study the number of forward extremities of the MEG over time and observe an almost optimal evolution. […] With the properties shown, a MEG represents a promising element in the set of data structures for decentralized applications, but with distinct trade-offs compared to traditional blockchains and distributed ledger technologies.

## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Synapse

Synapse is a popular homeserver written in Python.

[callahad](https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org) announced:

> Hey, it's Friday!
>
> We [released Synapse 1.28 yesterday](https://matrix.org/blog/2021/02/25/synapse-1-28-0-released), with the bulk of effort going into stability improvements and bug fixes, and an emphasis on further improving social login.
>
> We're also working to more clearly communicate our prioritization of issues, starting with documenting our [triage and labeling process](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9460) for the core Synapse repository on GitHub.
>
> (Still very much a work in progress, but starting to shape up nicely.)
>
> We're also on track to maintain our fortnightly cadence of Release Candidates, with 1.29.0rc1 due out in just a few days. I look forward to telling you all about it next week!

## Homeserver Deployment 📥️

### Kubernetes

[Ananace](https://matrix.to/#/@ace:kittenface.studio) offered:

> Another week, another bump of the Kubernetes [chart](https://gitlab.com/ananace/charts) and [image](https://github.com/ananace/matrix-synapse) of Synapse (to 1.28.0), still haven't had time to fix it to be image agnostic - the Synapse team is just developing far too fast.

## Dept of Bridges 🌉

### Gitter

[Eric Eastwood](https://matrix.to/#/@madlittlemods:matrix.org) announced:

> We've added a "Chat via Matrix" button next to the join button in a Gitter room so you can jump straight into Matrix and start chatting that way. We've also added a Matrix.to link in the chat header so you can switch off to your favorite Matrix client at any time.

### Nheko

[Nheko](https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko) is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at

![2021-02-26-M_N-6-clipboard.png](/blog/img/2021-02-26-M_N-6-clipboard.png)

[Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)](https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev) sent a teaser image first, then added:

> As seen from the image, you can now share your screen. This currently only works on X11, since there are no cross platform APIs for that, so look out for that, if you run into issues.
>
> Jedi18 also polished the UX a bit more and fixed bugs, so registration should now work properly again and leaving or joining rooms should place you in the right rooms after that. We also fixed some inconsistencies, where text could be misaligned, when writing long messages.

### Quaternion

[kitsune](https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org) reported:

> Version 0.0.95 beta4 is out, with significantly better Markdown support (code fences work now, and the overall formatting is better), further improvements to the shuttle dial and other smaller fixes. The release notes and some packages are at their [usual place at GitHub](https://github.com/quotient-im/Quaternion/releases/tag/0.0.95-beta4); the Flatpak is also coming real-soon-now.
>
> No (or almost no) changes in strings are expected before 0.0.95 from now, so translation contributions are very welcome at [Lokalise](https://app.lokalise.com/project/730769035bbc328c31e863.62506391). German, Polish and Spanish translations are quite advanced but need just a few more entries; the French translation is just about half-way; and there are many prominent languages not even started. You can help!

### Caridina, Crystal library for Matrix

[erdnaxeli](https://matrix.to/#/@erdnaxeli:cervoi.se) said:

> [Caridina](https://github.com/erdnaxeli/caridina), a [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/) library for Matrix, got some new releases, which bring it to v0.10.2. It now supports the last version of Crystal (0.36.1) and redacted events, which I discovered the hard way were making the lib crash. Internally a big part of the lib was rewritten using macros, which makes the code a lot clearer but the [API doc](https://erdnaxeli.github.io/caridina/Caridina/Events.html) too. Thanks to Ruma actually for giving me inspiration about implementing events using macros.
>
> Again, if you like Crystal and want to write some matrix bot, this library might interest you. Feel free to open issues about bugs or feature requests! There is now a room [#caridina:cervoi.se](https://matrix.to/#/#caridina:cervoi.se) to talk about it.

## Dept of Bots 🤖

### taavi

[select](https://matrix.to/#/@select:matrix.org) announced:

> So I had a minute to release my open q&a bot taavi.
>
> I always wanted to write a chatbot that does cool things, so checkmark for that one on the list. In addition to that I recently failed a job interview. For their technical skill test (I did not fail this :P), I got a task for which I learned how to use `puppeteer`, then saw a post on reddit about [Tuxi](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/lk1il3/no_need_of_alexa_siri_cortana_i_am_happy_with_my/) and together with my previous project that included Matrix ([Audius](https://github.com/select/audius)), I knew what I had to do: create Taavi.
>
> I have created this bot as a "weekend project", literally one day for the code and one day for documentation. Surely it's far from perfect but I don't have any big plans with it so far… If you think I should add some features, [create an issue](https://gitlab.com/s3lect/taavi-chat-bot/-/issues) and let me know. I could imagine adding other websites / services to it like last.fm, do you have any ideas?
>
> I gave my daughter the task to choose a name for a bot, that can answer any question in the world, and she came up with Taavi, nice!

[JCG](https://matrix.to/#/@jan.christian:gruenhage.xyz) said:

> Not sure if TWIM worthy, but here's [a nice article about the recent flood of people migrating away from whatsapp](https://www.republik.ch/2021/02/24/kill-the-messenger), and why people should've migrated to matrix instead of Signal.

(In German)

There is also [a sympathetic response](https://stuker.com/2021/whatsapp-and-most-alternatives-share-the-same-problem/) that has been [discussed on HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26273594).
