## Dept of Spec 📜

### Spec

[anoa](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz) offered:

### MSC3013

[sorunome](https://matrix.to/#/@sorunome:sorunome.de) said:

> Soru has been working on experimenting with / designing a way to improve push systems within the matrix ecosystem, so that ideally clients can display full event contents in a notification and dispose of specific push notifications without the need for any extra HTTP calls. This lead her to making [MSC3013](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3013) (encrypted push), so that no gateway is able to read event contents pushed down to the client and [MSC3014](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3014), so that the client can know which rooms have been read on other devices, allowing them to dispose push notifications.
>
> This is more than just MSCs already, soru already got encrypted push in a patched synapse and a patched fluffychat working locally, and it is working super great!
>
> Dunno soru is just really excited about this somehow `>~<` 🦊

## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Hedwig: push gateway

[krille](https://matrix.to/#/@krille:janian.de) reported:

> Let's talk more about Hedwig: This is a push gateway for matrix and an alternative to Sygnal. Hedwig is completely written from scratch in Rust (Yes! Rust!) and offers the basic functionality to forward matrix push notifications to Firebase Cloud Messaging. That's it. Nothing more. It is intended to be as lightweight as possible and so it is very fast and stable. Just change a simple config.toml file and run the binary. There are docs for how you can configure a proxy in Apache2 and an example systemD service file. Currently it only supports event_id_only formatted notifications but maybe, in the future, we expand this functionality.

Learn more: <https://gitlab.com/famedly/services/hedwig>

### Dendrite / gomatrixserverlib

Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go

[Neil Alexander](https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org) reported:

> This week we released [Dendrite 0.3.10](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/releases/tag/v0.3.10), and have committed a couple more fixes to `master`:
>
> * The database is now only queried for remote servers once in `/send`
>
> * The oldest cache entries are now gradually evicted, saving a small amount of memory
> * The destination queues in the federation sender are now not stored forever, saving some memory
>
> * A bug where a non-excluded event could be accidentally excluded from `/sync` has been fixed
> * Some dependency fixes have been merged
>
> Sytest compliance:
>
> * Client-server APIs: 60%
>
> * Server-server APIs: 82%
>
> As always, feel free to join us in [#dendrite:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org) for general Dendrite chat or [#dendrite-dev:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite-dev:matrix.org) for development discussion.

### Synapse

Synapse is a popular homeserver written in Python.

[callahad](https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org) reported:

> Synapse 1.27 is out, and you can [read all about it](https://matrix.org/blog/2021/02/18/synapse-1-27-0-released) on the Matrix Blog! This is the version that powered FOSDEM, and we're super proud of it. Especially the much improved support for multiple social login providers, which debuted at FOSDEM and is now enabled on matrix.org.
>
> In addition to all the performance, stability, and social login improvements, there are two important things to note:
>
> 1. If you use SSO, you will need update your configuration before upgrading; please see the link above for details.
> 2. We were unable to build Docker images for ARM platforms in time for this release, and will not build images for ARMv7 in future releases.
>
> * To avoid unexpected breakage, we have not updated the  `latest` tag on Docker Hub for this release; if you want Synapse 1.27, you'll need to specifically reference the `v1.27.0` tag.
>
> * Images for ARM64 (and an updated `latest` tag) will return with the next Synapse release.
>
> It took us a bit longer than usual to get 1.27 out the door, so we're also pleased to announce that [1.28.0rc1](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.28.0rc1) is also now available, and we expect to release it early next week. Keep your eyes peeled for more on that next week!

## Homeserver Deployment 📥️

### Kubernetes

[Ananace](https://matrix.to/#/@ace:kittenface.studio) announced:

> New [chart](https://gitlab.com/ananace/charts) versions have been pushed for Element 1.7.21 and Synapse 1.27.0.
>
> The rejiggering to allow arbitrary images for the Kubernetes chart got delayed due to lack of time, but 1.27.0 should hopefully be the last version with that limitation.

## Dept of Clients 📱

### Nio

[Nio](https://nio.chat) is a client written with SwiftUI

[kilian](https://matrix.to/#/@kilian:kernkraftwerk.lol) offered:

> [Nio](https://nio.chat/) has seen some great improvements since the last update, mostly thanks to gaining a new main contributor \o/
>
> * History loading now works (seems like a rather essential messenger feature 😄)
>
> * New conversations can be started (with a slick UI)
> * There's a preliminary (but well-working!) build for macOS on Catalyst
>
> * As a first step towards E2EE support Nio can now participate in encrypted sessions while running
> * _Many_ new translations (thanks to all the contributors on translate.element.io!)
>
> * Lots of additional bugfixes and improvements
>
> Join us in [#niochat:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#niochat:matrix.org) for more details 😊

### FluffyChat

[FluffyChat](https://fluffychat.im) is a cute cross-platform matrix client. It is available for Android, iOS, Web and Desktop.

[krille](https://matrix.to/#/@krille:janian.de) said:

> FluffyChat 0.27.0 is out. Not with the new design but with some minor design improvements like the return of the presence list top bar (or whatever you would name it!). Also this release brings a lot of bug fixes, working bootstrapping and the switch to our new Push Gateway (in Rust) we have invented inside of Famedly. You can find it here: <https://gitlab.com/famedly/services/hedwig>

### FluffyChat on Pinephone

[Lukas Lihotzki](https://matrix.to/#/@lukas:lihotzki.de) said:

> FluffyChat runs on the PinePhone (Flutter Linux ARM64). I've built it with flutter master on the PinePhone itself, because cross-compiling is not yet supported. Currently, Flutter Linux on the PinePhone only works with X11. It crashes with Wayland.

I am on the brink of buying one of these!

![2021-02-19-2Lo26-pine.png](/blog/img/2021-02-19-2Lo26-pine.png)

### Nheko

[Nheko](https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko) is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE (with the notable exception being device verification for now) and intends to be full featured and nice to look at

[Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)](https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev) told us:

> We had a fun week this time. Today I tested trilenes screen sharing code, which seems to work pretty well on X11, although it only shares the full screen atm. I expect window sharing to land next week though. We also ran into some issues with matrix.org enabling optional SSO login, which locked some people out of their accounts, since Nheko preferred SSO login in that case... This is now fixed and in such cases you will be offered both login flows.
>
> Jedi18 also added a room name completer, which means you can finally complete aliases when typing them! The room settings were also ported to Qml and now actually show the room topic. Apart from that there were various UX fixes here ad there, like hovering actually working properly now, emote messages formatting correctly in notifications and more. We also adapted the matrix: uri support to the latest changes, although the MSC is a bit volatile atm, so it may need some more adaptions over time.
>
> I think that's all, have a nice weekend everyone!

### Hydrogen

[Bruno](https://matrix.to/#/@bwindels:matrix.org) announced:

> I'm back working on Hydrogen, and started to tackle logging to be able to diagnose problems better. I've opted for a structured log format in JSON that gives a tree of log nodes for an entire operation (e.g. sync, or sending a message, ...) which will be more compact and should also be easier to find patterns in than a pure line based format. I had hoped to get that out in a release by today but didn't get as far as I hoped, so should get released early next week.

![2021-02-19-VTLG5-image.png](/blog/img/2021-02-19-VTLG5-image.png)

Yes! Hydrogen progresses!

### Element

[Neil](https://matrix.to/#/@neilj:matrix.org) told us:

> **Delight**
>
>
>
> * Social Login
>
>     * Social log-in has shipped to matrix.org, we are seeing about 40% of new users opting for a social method. Next up will be landing some robustness improvements as well as automatic avatar import.
>
> * Spaces
>
>     * We are aiming to get a basic version up and ready over the next few weeks. The idea is to have something behind a labs flag that will work for Spaces containing public rooms only. After that we will think about more complex cases such as Spaces containing private rooms.
>
> **VoIP**
>
>
>
> * Fix for crash on Android caused by VoIP tiles
>
> * Design updates on iOS for in-call view and dial pad
> * Couple of tweaks to web that may help 1:1 call connectivity
>
> **Web**
>
>
>
> * Element 1.7.21 was released on Monday (15 Feb)
>
> **iOS**
>
>
>
> * Element [1.2.1](https://github.com/vector-im/element-ios/releases) was released on Friday (12 Feb)
>
> * We now use XcodeGen to generate Xcode project files. Please check [new instructions](https://github.com/vector-im/element-ios#build-instructions)to build the project. It is only on develop for the moment
> * We made an update to libolm so that it accepts an external pickle key to encrypt its data when serialising it. Element-iOS uses the Keychain to provide this key.
>
> * We started to review and merge pending PRs in our repos but we still have work. Thanks for your contributions and patience
>
> **Android**
>
>
>
> * We are preparing the release 1.1.0 which contains the work on VoIP
>
> * This release will also contain a lot of bug fixes

## Matrix in the News 📰

[Shine](https://matrix.to/#/@shiny:shine.horse) reported:

> Dunno if twim worthy? Proton mentioned Matrix in <https://protonmail.com/blog/whatsapp-alternatives/>

Seems to be worthy, it's been included anyway!

## Final Thoughts 💭

[Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)](https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev) offered:

> Oh, and maybe as a side note: Since Steam voice chat failed me one too many times now, I now use Nheko for voice chat, if I just play with one other player. It is more reliable and most people I play with do have a voip capable Matrix client installed!

Using own product 😀 👍

[TR_SLimey](https://matrix.to/#/@tr_slimey:an-atom-in.space) said:

> It seems neochat has made it into the Plasma 5.21 preview video, albeit not quite as one might expect :P

> Here's the video link: <https://youtu.be/ahEWG4JCA1w>

That indeed is an unusual way to get featured, well done NeoChat!
