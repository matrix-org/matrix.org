## Dept of *Status of Matrix* 🌡️

We missed it at the time, but wanted to share in TWIM. [Terence Eden](https://shkspr.mobi/), noted UK technologist, shared a [thorough, compelling argument for the UK Government to use Matrix as a foundation for the digital workplace](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2021/05/msc-first-assignment-technical-and-digital-leadership/).

This is a long read, but a detailed argument. Also please note that this is was produced for the purpose of an MSc course of study, it was not commissioned for any other purpose, as the preamble makes clear.

Next, a high billing for Beeper this week, who have been working hard and getting product out!

### Beeper update

[Tulir](https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net) reported:

> It's been a month since our last update. A lot of the work since then has been on making everything more reliable, but we've also added new features to our clients and started making some new bridges.
>
> **Desktop**
>
> * Added thread UI for Slack-bridged rooms. Internally they're just replies like before, but the client will intelligently collapse replies in Slack rooms into threads.
>
> * Merged upstream Element additions like voice messages.
>   * Also merged some features that aren't in Element yet, like [Giphy integration](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/5814).
>
> **iOS**
>
> * Released Beeper iOS to Testflight.
>
> **Android**
>
> * Added grouping rooms by chat network based on the `m.bridge` state event. The UI is similar to spaces, but they're not actual Matrix spaces (yet).
>
> * Added support for Android 11's "conversation" notifications.
>
> **Bridges**
>
> * Android Messages is turning out difficult to reverse-engineer to a sufficiently reliable level, so we're building a new SMS bridge into our Android app. It'll also be available as a standalone open-source app, which already exists at https://gitlab.com/beeper/android-sms (but doesn't have any setup instructions yet).
>
> * We've funded development of a LinkedIn bridge. sumner will post a more detailed update about that.
>
> We're hiring React, iOS, Android and SRE/Devops engineers. If you're interested, check out https://angel.co/company/beeperhq or DM [Eric Migicovsky](https://matrix.to/#/@eric:beeper.com).

## Dept of Spec 📜

MSC state changes:
- "[MSC3262 aPAKE authentication](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3262)" was created.
- "[MSC2918: Refresh tokens](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2918)" was proposed for FCP

Bruno has been working on aggregations as part of his work for Hydrogen. He reported:
> I've been cleaning up the relations MSCs, finding a balance between documenting the current state and not losing track of community concerns. I've started with [MSC 2674](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2674) which is the very basic format of relations, and will move on to annotations/reactions ([MSC 2677](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2677)) next week.

## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Synapse

Synapse is a popular homeserver written in Python.

[callahad](https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org) announced:

> We're pleased to announce the [release of Synapse 1.37.1](https://matrix.org/blog/2021/06/30/security-update-synapse-1-37-1-released) this week, which includes mitigations for the recent distributed spam attack across the public Matrix network. **We advise upgrading as soon as possible.**
>
> Otherwise, Synapse 1.37 highlights include:
>
> * A new, [generic interface for extension modules](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.37/modules.html) (See this week's Matrix Live for more info!)
>
> * Completed server-side support for [MSC2403: Add "knock" feature](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403) and [Room Version 7](https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/rooms/v7/).
> * An experimental implementation of [MSC2716: Incrementally importing history into existing rooms](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2716) ([#9247](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/9247)) as part of Element's work to fully [integrate Gitter into Matrix](https://matrix.org/blog/2020/09/30/welcoming-gitter-to-matrix).
>
> * A more nuanced implementation of Synapse's optional user-interactive authentication ("UIA") grace period ([#10184](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/10184)).
>
> ...and a bunch of smaller bug fixes and performance improvements.
>
> Check out the [blog post](https://matrix.org/blog/2021/06/30/security-update-synapse-1-37-1-released) for more.

## Homeserver Deployment 📥️

### Kubernetes

[Ananace](https://matrix.to/#/@ace:kittenface.studio) offered:

> Got another week of [Helm Chart](https://gitlab.com/ananace/charts) updates, with the Synapse chart getting a bunch of worker improvements and additional configurability, as well as being updated to first 1.37.0 and then 1.37.1

## Dept of Bridges 🌉

### LinkedIn <-> Matrix Bridge

[sumner](https://matrix.to/#/@sumner:sumnerevans.com) reported:

> I'm excited to announce that I started working on a new bridge for bringing LinkedIn messages to Matrix! It's currently in the early stages of development and not production-ready. The current feature set includes: backfill from LinkedIn, user name and profile picture sync, message sending from Matrix -> LinkedIn, and real-time message puppetting from LinkedIn -> Matrix. There's much more to come, and you can join [#linkedin-matrix:nevarro.space](https://matrix.to/#/#linkedin-matrix:nevarro.space)  for updates. Development is being funded by Beeper, and is being designed with integration into Beeper as it's primary goal. However, the bridge is open source (Apache 2.0) and will be available to self-host. The source code is here: https://github.com/sumnerevans/linkedin-matrix.

Great work from Sumner! Glad to see people have the *option* to bridge their LinkedIn messages!

### matrix-puppeteer-line update

[Fair](https://matrix.to/#/@fair:miscworks.net) reported:

> [matrix-puppeteer-line](https://src.miscworks.net/fair/matrix-puppeteer-line/): A bridge for LINE Messenger based on running LINE's Chrome extension in Puppeteer.
>
> Better LINE->Matrix read receipt bridging is now supported in the `testing` branch! The bridge now checks all LINE chats (not just the most recently-used one) to see if messages you sent have been read (in LINE). This works by cycling through all LINE chats where the final message is posted by you and doesn't have a "Read" marker on it yet (or for multi-user chats, if your last message hasn't been read by everyone in the room).
>
> With that, I'll consider the bridge to be in Early Beta! 🎉 I'm now testing the bridge for myself to iron out a few kinks, and am preparing a PR to the [matrix.org](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/) webpage to have this listed on https://matrix.org/bridges/.

> Issue page: https://src.miscworks.net/fair/matrix-puppeteer-line/issues

### Matrix Adapter for WebThings 0.4.0

[Christian](https://matrix.to/#/@christianp:vector.modular.im) told us:

> This addon for the WebThings gateway lets you send Matrix messages when your IoT fridge is empty – or whatever you have connected to your gateway.
>
> The update fixes predefined messages getting sent to the default room and is the first to be tested against gateway version 1.0.0.
> https://gitlab.com/webthings/matrix-adapter or in the addon list of your WebThings gateway

## Dept of Clients 📱

### NeoChat

[Carl Schwan](https://matrix.to/#/@carl:kde.org) announced:

> This week, NeoChat gained support for a Global Menu on Plasma and macOS. Aside from that, we fixed a few crashes.
>
> But the biggest news of the week is that we will get funding from NLNet to implement E2EE support in Quotient and NeoChat as part of their grants to improve the internet. We will report on our progress on that front here!

This is terrific news, big thanks to [NLNet](https://nlnet.nl/) for making this choice!

### FluffyChat

[FluffyChat](https://fluffychat.im) is the cutest cross-platform matrix client. It is available for Android, iOS, Web and Desktop.

[krille](https://matrix.to/#/@krille:janian.de) said:

> FluffyChat 0.33.0 has been released.
>
> Just a more minor bugfixing release with some design changes in the settings, updated missing translations and for rebuilding the arm64 Linux Flatpak.
>
> #### Features
>
> * redesigned settings
>
> * Updated translations - thanks to all translators
> * display progress bar in first sync
>
> * changed Linux window default size
> * update some dependencies
>
> #### Fixes
>
> * Favicon on web
>
> * Database not storing files correctly
> * Linux builds for arm64
>
> * a lot of minor bugs

### Nheko

[Nheko](https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko) is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at

[Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)](https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev) offered:

> Hello World! I am here to bring you Nheko news!
>
> We merged the Spaces branch, which means Nheko master can now show some spaces. Peeking unjoined rooms, nesting spaces and creating them should be coming soon. We are also looking into how to fit knocking into the UI (we already rendered incoming knocks in the timeline for a while).
>
> You can also now edit still pending messages, which should help if your server is slow and you notice a typo. The edit will then get queued and be sent as soon as the server acknowledges they received the original message. Apart from that there have been some improvements to the readability of the room list and some other UI elements.
>
> Last but not least, we switched out our entire http backend from Boost to Curl. For that I wrote a [simple wrapper around Curl](https://nheko.im/nheko-reborn/coeurl). This fixes about 10 issues around connection shutdown, brings proxy support, http/2 and http/3 support and in general makes Nheko crash less and reduces latency a LOT! This will obviously cause some pain for packagers, but I hope it isn't too bad. Some of the issues this fixes only had 2 digits in our bugtracker and one was even filed by benpa!
>
> Have a nice weekend everyone! ♥

### Fractal

[Alexandre Franke](https://matrix.to/#/@afranke:matrix.org) told us:

> Chris tweaked the UI in various places. It’s a lot of small details that together make for a smoother experience. I encourage you to read the details in the description of [!782](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/782). This is the only MR that landed since [last week](https://matrix.org/blog/2021/06/25/this-week-in-matrix-2021-06-25#fractal), but our people have been hard at work nonetheless. Kai blogged about his journey working on the [search bar of doom](https://blog.kaialexhiller.de/?p=29) and Alejandro [shared his own struggle](https://aledomu.github.io/gnome/small-progress-update-of-my-2021-gsoc-with-fractal-next/). In the meantime, Julian’s work has mostly happened [upstream](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/288) in matrix-rust-sdk.

## Dept of Bots 🤖

### Mjolnir

[TravisR](https://github.com/turt2live) offered:

> [Mjolnir](https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir) is a moderation bot for communities on Matrix. It helps with a lot of the actions covered by the [moderation guide](https://matrix.org/docs/guides/moderation), including capabilities to apply bans from other trusted communities. It's still a bit terse in its documentation, but if you're looking for a featureful moderation bot then it's worth a go. 
>
> In related news, Mjolnir [v0.1.18](https://github.com/matrix-org/mjolnir/releases/tag/v0.1.18) is out with a couple quality of life fixes - if you've been bothered by the log spam, it's now fixed :)

## Dept of Guides 🧭

### Matrix Limits

[Ryan](https://matrix.to/#/@jryans:matrix.org) said:

> I started a [tiny repo](https://github.com/jryans/matrix-limits) to collect various limits and related factoids about the Matrix specification and implementations. I hope that distilling and summarising such things at glance will make it easier to see what is and is not possible.
