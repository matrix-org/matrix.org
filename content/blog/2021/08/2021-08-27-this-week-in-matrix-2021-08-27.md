## Matrix Live 🎙

{{ youtube_player(video_id="IZ8apQErlrc") }}

These Hydrogen news leave me breathless!

[Bruno](https://matrix.to/#/@bwindels:matrix.org) also shared the news about the latest release:

> Hydrogen [0.2.7](https://github.com/vector-im/hydrogen-web/releases/tag/v0.2.7) with Single Sign-on and well-known lookup also got released this week

## Dept of Spec 📜

### Spec

[anoa](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz) told us:

> Here's your weekly spec update! The heart of Matrix is the specification - and this is modified by Matrix Spec Change (MSC) proposals. Learn more about how the process works at <https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals>.
>
>
> #### MSC Status
>
> **New MSCs:**
>
> * [[WIP] MSC3361: Opportunistic Direct Push](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3361)
> * [MSC3360: Server Status](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3360)
>
> * [[WIP] MSC3359: Delayed Push](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3359)
> * [MSC3356: Add additional OpenID user info fields](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3356)
>
> **MSCs with proposed Final Comment Period:**
>
> * *No MSCs entered proposed FCP state this week.*
>
> **MSCs in Final Comment Period:**
>
> * [MSC2918: Refresh tokens](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2918) (merge)
> * [MSC2582: Remove mimetype from EncryptedFile object](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2582) (merge)
>
> **Merged MSCs:**
>
> * *No MSCs were merged this week.*
>
> #### Spec Updates
>
> [MSC2582](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2582) (Removing mimetype from EncryptedFile object) was one of those MSCs that were relatively small, but had been languishing for *ages*. Partly because it required client implementations to update, but also partly because one needed to go in after a while and actually confirm that all known clients had updated. @uhoreg took up the mantle on his own to do so, and as a result this MSC has hit FCP and is soon to be merged. Thank you!
>
> #### Random MSC of the Week
>
> The random MSC of the week is [MSC3262: aPAKE authentication](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3262)!
>
> Alongside [MSC2957](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2957) and [MSC3265](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3265), this MSC is requesting a better way of communicating one's password to the homeserver without sending it in plaintext (over TLS, hopefully).
>
> Remember that this is only done in exchange for an access token, which is then used for all subsequent requests. Still though, I can see the merit!

## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Synapse

[callahad](https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org) told us:

> Synapse 1.41.0 is out! Check the [release announcement](https://matrix.org/blog/2021/08/24/synapse-1-41-0-released) to find out about all of the details, including progress on MSCs, great new Admin APIs, and the ability to handle the `/createRoom` endpoint on workers. As mentioned in last week's TWiM, Synapse 1.41 uses [MSC3244: Room version capabilities](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3244) to tell clients that they can and should use Room Version 8 when creating [restricted rooms](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083). The future is here!
>
> We've also stopped publishing Debian packages for Ubuntu 20.10 (Groovy).
>
> ⚠️ We expect to publish a **security release** Synapse 1.41.1 on Tuesday, 31 August which fixes two moderate severity issues.
>
> Lastly, the Synapse team would like to extend a warm welcome to Sean Quah, who joined Element's backend team this week. Welcome, Sean!

### NeoChat

[Carl Schwan](https://matrix.to/#/@carl:kde.org) said:

> This week Tobias implemented blurhash in NeoChat for a smoother image loading experience. Tobias also continued working on E2EE and this past week his focus was on decrypting encrypted files.

### Ement.el

[alphapapa](https://matrix.to/#/@alphapapa:matrix.org) said:

> [Ement.el](https://github.com/alphapapa/ement.el), a Matrix client for Emacs, gained some more improvements this week:
>
> * Multi-account support was merged, so you can now use multiple accounts at the same time.  You can even be in the same room in two different accounts, at the same time, in side-by-side windows (which is useful for testing).  (Note that existing users will need to log in again, because the format of the saved-session file changed.)
>
> * Rooms you have been invited to now show up in the rooms list, and you can join them by clicking a button in the room's buffer.
> * Encrypted rooms now display a warning in the header and suggest that users consider using [Pantalaimon](https://github.com/matrix-org/pantalaimon/).
>
> * Membership events are now formatted more usefully, similar to Element's style.
> * Completion for room and user names and IDs is implemented using standard Emacs commands and bindings (i.e. `C-M-i` by default).
>
> * The last-read marker may be jumped to, even if it's at an earlier event that has not yet been retrieved.
> * Emotes (i.e. `/me`-style messages) can be sent by pressing `e`.
>
> * Timestamps in the room list are shaded according to how "hot" (i.e. recently updated) the room is (see screenshot).
> * Various small fixes and enhancements.
>
> Feel free to join us in [#ement.el:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#ement.el:matrix.org)!

### Nheko

[Nheko](https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko) is a desktop client using Qt and C++17. It supports E2EE and intends to be full featured and nice to look at

[Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)](https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev) said:

> Nheko now supports uploading to online key backup and warns you before enabling it, that we don't recommend using the asymmetric version. If you update to one of the current builds (and or the next version), you will also experience a bit longer load times on first startup. That is because we force-cleared the cache to be able to handle the new goodies like spaces and sticker/emote-packs. In the best case, everything is seamless.
>
> We also had contributions by various people:
>
> * resolritter cleaned up that while tab moved you down most popup lists, it didn't move up when shift was pressed.
>
> * Harmathy extended the FAQ to answer commonly asked questions like "Does Nheko support E2EE" or "What commands are supported". Don't worry, we know most of you won't read that and will still answer that question when you undoubtedly come asking it again. We just can now be even more passive aggressive than just pointing at the right wiki page. Instead we will point at the FAQ now, which will point at the wiki!
> * thombles made the emoji completer behave more nicely. Instead of jumping to the bottom left corner before closing, it will now just close. It should also now behave correctly when selecting text.
>
> * alfasi updated the install instructions for Gentoo.
>
> I'm not sure we have ever seen that many new faces contributing to Nheko in a week, I'm pretty happy to see that!

### Fractal

Busy week in Fractal land! It is the end for GSoC, but it’s not really over. While some merge requests from our interns are still ongoing, Julian merged a bunch of them. On Kai’s side, the long awaited [Room details](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/789) are finally here. Alejandro, on the other hand, landed code to [get display name and avatar of accounts at startup](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/merge_requests/802).

### Circles

[cvwright](https://matrix.to/#/@cvwright:matrix.org) offered:

> [Circles](https://github.com/KombuchaPrivacy/circles-ios) is a project to build a secure, end-to-end encrypted social network on top of Matrix.  The iOS app is currently in the final stages of beta testing in preparation for a 1.0 release.
>
> Updates this week include:
>
> * Fixed a bug that prevented some new users from registering.  If you tried to sign up last week but the email validation failed, please give it another try with the latest build.
>
> * Cleaned up the "Home" tab for a simpler, cleaner look.
> * Fixed a bug where the summary of recent activity was failing to load on app startup.  Also added a manual "refresh" button as a fallback.
>
> If you would like to try the latest Circles beta (v0.93), you can get it from Apple [here](https://testflight.apple.com/join/cWuDwqpG)

### Element Clients

Updates from the teams

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line no-emphasis-as-heading -->
**Delight team**

* Room version 8 was marked as the preferred version for [MSC3083 restricted rooms](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/3083) on matrix.org and in Synapse 1.41, released this week. This means Element clients can now show UI to create restricted rooms within a Space, and prompt users to upgrade rooms if necessary when making them restricted.
* Improvements to the performance of the room summary API.
* Lots of testing of Spaces in anticipation of it leaving beta.

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line no-emphasis-as-heading -->
**VoIP**

* Fix cases where a call ringtone would continue even after the call was answered.
* Add active speaker indicators when a user in a call is currently talking.
* Working on showing call duration in call tiles.

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line no-emphasis-as-heading -->
**Web**

* We’ve released 1.8.2 RC3 which includes fixes to windows font rendering, blur hashing and accessibility improvements, and other bugs.
* Our internal threads prototype is in code review.
* This week, we’ve been doing more work on threads, fixed some more cross-signing bugs, iterating on more compact replies, and investigating our process for translations.

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line no-emphasis-as-heading -->
**iOS**

* Continue to work on URL preview.
* App Navigation improvement: Continue to work on room navigation.
* Account notification settings are now available.
* Voice message rendering and playback fixes have been made.
* We added a banner to advertise that iOS 11 will be dropped soon.
* Room creation: prevent room duplication on creation.
* Media upload sizing: Continue to improve media size selection.

<!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line no-emphasis-as-heading -->
**Android**

* We are still improving the experience with Spaces
* Notifications setting will be updated in the next release, with the ability to get notified when keywords are included in any message (only on un-encrypted rooms for now)
* Working on Olm fallback key support
* Besides that we are fixing bugs across the application and the SDK. We have fixed the issue of crashing when opening a room on devices running API 21. The fix will be in the next release.

### Ruma

[Ruma](https://ruma.dev/) is a set of Rust library crates around Matrix

[jplatte](https://matrix.to/#/@jplatte:flipdot.org) reported:

> It's been so long since our last update that I couldn't possibly list all of the individual changes, but here's a rough overview of the work since then (three months ago):
>
> There's been loads of bug fixes, many compatibility improvements and at least one large refactoring. We've been much faster about releasing changes to crates.io after ruma 0.1.0, now we're already at ruma 0.4.0 (!);  the changes needed to upgrade are really not that significant though. Notable areas of improvement are
>
> * UIAA: No more stringly-typed auth type + map of properties. The `AuthData` enum that holds the authentication information clients send to servers now has one variant for every auth type defined in the spec.
>
> * Event relations: These used to be serialized wrongly for encrypted events and were only (de)serializable as part of a larger event (making using them in custom ways impossible). Both of these issues were fixed.
>
> Additionally, the GSoC coding period is over and our students have both written a blog post summarizing their work: [API Coverage project (Adam Blanchet)](https://ruma.dev/news/gsoc-coverage/), [Tooling project (Devin Ragotzy)](https://ruma.dev/news/gsoc-tools/)
>
> If you want more detailed updates about Ruma, please watch [our repository](https://github.com/ruma/ruma)'s GitHub releases, since nobody in the project currently wants to write regular blog posts or TWIM updates (if you are interested in changing that, get in touch over at [#ruma:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#ruma:matrix.org)).

### libQuotient

[kitsune](https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org) reported:

> This week a new stable version of libQuotient, 0.6.8, has been [released](https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/releases/tag/0.6.8). While the main focus has been fixing bugs and sustaining the codebase, one significant highlight is that read receipts and fully read markers are distinguished now, which should improve interaction with other clients that has been treating them differently for quite some time now. This version is anticipated to become the base of the upcoming Quaternion 0.0.95.

### Simple-Matrix-Bot-Lib

[krazykirby99999](https://matrix.to/#/@krazykirby99999:matrix.org) offered:

> #### Version 2.0.0 Released
>
> The second major version of the simplematrixbotlib package has been released. It is available from [Github](https://github.com/KrazyKirby99999/simple-matrix-bot-lib) and [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/simplematrixbotlib/2.0.0/).
>
> Example usage is shown below:
>
> ```python
>
> #### echo.py
> #### Example:
>
> #### randomuser - "!echo example string"
> #### echo_bot - "example string"
>
> import simplematrixbotlib as botlib
>
> creds = botlib.Creds("https://home.server", "echo_bot", "pass")
>
> bot = botlib.Bot(creds)
> PREFIX = '!'
>
> @bot.listener.on_message_event
>
> async def echo(room, message):
>     match = botlib.MessageMatch(room, message, bot, PREFIX)
>
>     if match.is_not_from_this_bot() and match.prefix() and match.command("echo"):
>
>         await bot.api.send_text_message(
>
>             room.room_id, " ".join(arg for arg in match.args())
>             )
>
> bot.run()
>
> ```
>
> You can find the quickstart [here](https://simple-matrix-bot-lib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html).

## Final Thoughts 💭

### Room of the week

[timokoesters](https://matrix.to/#/@timokoesters:fachschaften.org) told us:

> Hi everyone! Did you ever feel lost in the Matrix world? The room directory is big, but it's still hard to find something you like. Or are you a room moderator, but there is not much activity in your room because it doesn't have enough users?
>
> This is why I want to share rooms (or spaces) I find interesting.
