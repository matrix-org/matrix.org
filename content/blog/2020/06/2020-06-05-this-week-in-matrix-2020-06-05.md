## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Mascarene

[Nico](https://matrix.to/#/@nico:beerfactory.org) said:

> [Mascarene](https://gitlab.com/mascarene/mascarene) is a quite new homeserver implementation project started a few months ago. Now it's time to introduce it.
>
> Mascarene is written in [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/), runs on JVM and relies on [Akka](https://akka.io/) actor model. Out of the box it provides features like efficient streaming I/O, clustering and live data distribution. Data are backed in a PostgreSQL database.
>
> The project is in early stage but already provides a few endpoints which make Mascarene able to talk to Riot.
>
> You can test it at <https://snapshot.mascarene.org>. You should be able to register, login, create a room and talk to yourself.
>
> Current work is focused on client API implementation; federation or e2ee will come later.
>
> Contributions are welcome, join us on [#mascarene:beerfactory.org](https://matrix.to/#/#mascarene:beerfactory.org)

### Conduit

Conduit is a Matrix homeserver written in Rust <https://conduit.rs>

[timo](https://matrix.to/#/@timo:koesters.xyz) told us:

> Welcome back! This week I went through the whole Client-Server API and wrote down everything that is still missing from Conduit. You can find issues for all of them in the [milestone for Conduit 1.0](https://git.koesters.xyz/timo/conduit/milestones). This should make it more easy for contributors to find something to work on and gives a lot more structure to the repo (maybe I also did it, because it's so satisfying to close issues and see the milestone percentage go up 😛).
>
> Some of the issues I could already close this week include:
>
> * Implement redaction
>
> * Implement loading the message someone replied to (/context)
> * Fix bugs with notifications
>
> * Don't send typing events when nothing happened
> * Bundle typing events into one EDU
>
> * Don't send notification counts every /sync
> * Implement heroes
>
> As you can tell, a lot of work is starting to go into smaller improvements, which is a good thing, because it means most of the core work is already done!
>
> Thanks to my supporters on [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/timokoesters) (Take a look, I improved it 🙂).

### Synapse

[Neil](https://matrix.to/#/@neilj:matrix.org) told us:

> This week in Synapse land we have been focusing on bug fixes especially SSO and soft logout.
>
> We also spent some time thinking about how to further improve performance for large scale deployments (like matrix.org). In short this will mean sharding contested workers such as the media repo worker, the federation sender and the federation reader. We also want to remove some more functionality from the master process because it is still sitting at about 80% and we’d like some more head room. We'd also like to fix up the state compressor so it can easily be run as a background progress to save on disk space, this will benefit all installations big and small. Finally we want to speed up joins over federation. Exciting times.
>
> Next week, more of the same and we should start on some of the perf items. Also look out for changes to notification defaults.

### Dendrite / gomatrixserverlib

Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go

[Neil Alexander](https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org) offered:

> Updates:
>
> * Room version 6 support has been added
>
> * Server signing keys which have passed their validity period are now re-requested and updated properly, increasing reliability of federation substantially
> * Federated room joins have been significantly sped up by requesting missing auth events inline when verifying room state, rather than repeating the entire verification for each missing event
>
> * Local send-to-device support has been added (federated send-to-device coming soon)
> * A lot of code clean-up has taken place (with more to come), including cleaning up the internal APIs and the component bases
>
> * Decoding of room version 3 event IDs in request URLs has been improved
> * Inbound federation requests now interrupt backoff intervals on outbound sends
>
> * A new internal API exists now for interrupting backoff intervals on the federation sender
> * The federated `/devices` endpoint now returns in the correct format
>
> * Public rooms are now sorted by their member count
> * Only our own aliases are stored in the public rooms directory now
>
> * gomatrixserverlib is now responsible for marking room versions as supported/stable
> * Spec-compliant transactions are now sent to the appservice component
>
> * File URIs for SQLite databases are now set up using common functions
> * Handling registration for a user that already exists has been fixed (thanks [S7evinK](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/1076)!)
>
> * Dendrite can now be configured to use a HTTP proxy server for outbound HTTP (thanks [dr-bonez](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/pull/1055)!)
>
> Sytest compliance:
>
> * Client-server APIs: 36%
>
> * Server-server APIs: 35%
>
> In other news, Kegan wrote a post on [how p2p.riot.im works](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/wiki/How-p2p.riot.im-works), including Dendrite's journey to SQLite and WebAssembly!

Additionally! You may have already read about [v0.1.1 of the P2P Matrix demo](https://matrix.org/blog/2020/06/02/introducing-p-2-p-matrix) - this is a big update, with local storage, room alias handling, federation improvements and more!

### Tuple

[Alexander Eisele](https://matrix.to/#/@alexander:eiselecloud.de) reported:

> Tuple is a very early simple matrix <--> mqtt bridge for IOT and other embedded devices.
>
> It's my very first golang project, but it works(TM).
>
> * Repo: <https://gitlab.eiselecloud.de/matrix/tuple>
>
> * Discussion/Testing: [#tuple:eiselecloud.de](https://matrix.to/#/#tuple:eiselecloud.de)

This is exciting! I would love to see more IoT-related projects!

### mautrix-hangouts

[Tulir](https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net) reported:

> mautrix-hangouts can also do backfilling now, both when creating portal and missed messages when connecting

### mautrix-facebook

[Tulir](https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net) told us:

> mautrix-facebook got support for backfilling history when creating portals and backfilling missed messages when connecting. There's also an option to periodically reconnect to potentially fix the bug where Facebook decides that you don't get messages anymore, but doesn't actually disconnect you.

### mautrix-whatsapp

[Tulir](https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net) said:

> I had apparently forgotten to implement bridge information in the whatsapp bridge when I implemented it in my other bridges, but that mistake is now corrected. I also fixed a bug with encryption where it would generate too many one-time keys and cause messages to be undecryptable. Finally, mautrix-whatsapp had its first release this week since it's working reasonably well now.

## Dept of Clients 📱

### Radical Native

[stoic](https://matrix.to/#/@stoically:matrix.org) reported:

> Eager to test the keytar feature (pickle key stored in OS secret storage) with Riot Web? Support landed in [radical-native v0.1beta13](https://github.com/stoically/radical-native), which uses [Rust keytar bindings](https://github.com/stoically/keytar-rs) under the hood. Testing requires the latest and greatest of Riot Web, so riot.im/develop might be the place to see it in action

![2020-06-05-nyIuw-image.png](/blog/img/2020-06-05-nyIuw-image.png)

Keytar support is a [very very new feature](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/pull/1387), [uhoreg](https://matrix.to/#/@hubert:uhoreg.ca), who has been [working on it in the shadows](https://github.com/vector-im/riot-desktop/pull/95) and wasn't expecting to see it land yet, commented:

It's also now possible to switch between languages inside the app and to display the list of attachments (media and file) of a room. A new setting has been also added to hide redacted (deleted) events in the timeline. As Riot-Android SAS v2 is also included in this release. Also `formatted_body` for `m.notice` and `m.emote` are now taken into account.
>
> This week we were still working on implementing VoIP (audio and video call). Support for integration manager, widgets and sending stickers has been merged to develop.

### Riot-iOS

[Manu](https://matrix.to/#/@Manu:matrix.org) said:

> This week, we finalised our work around the iOS13 SDK. The coming public TestFlight (0.12.2) is the result of this work. It comes with a lot of changes including a full rewrite of the push handling codebase, trying to find solutions to make matrix e2ee compatible with iOS Notification Service Extension. Most of these changes are unfortunately invisible for end users. Please report any issues. Note this is safe to switch between this TF and 0.11.5.
>
> In parallel, we started to implement the cross-signing bootstrap and the recovery management. The UX of this is going to be refined on Riot-Web and RiotX-Android. Riot-iOS will implement the refined UX directly.

### Riot Web

A glossy Matrix collaboration client for the web. <https://riot.im>

[Ryan](https://matrix.to/#/@jryans:matrix.org) told us:

> We had several Riot Web releases this week, first with 1.6.3:
>
> * Security fix for auth handling in SSO deployments, thanks Quentin Gliech for responsible disclosure
>
> * Added more shortcuts to jump to read marker and upload a file
> * Fixed notification tray icon stability for desktop on Windows
>
> * Added an IRC style layout (currently available in labs only)
> * Added font scaling settings (currently available in labs only)
>
> * Fixed several bugs in the cross-signing bootstrap process
> * Converted older banner-style UI for updates etc. to newer toasts
>
> This was quickly followed by 1.6.4 to fix a few regressions with dismissing toasts, compact timeline layout, key backup, and tooltips on scroll.

> Get it on [pub](https://pub.dev/packages/matrix_sdk)!

### Ruma

Ruma is a Rust project to create a comprehensive set of APIs for Matrix. Previously there was a Ruma homeserver project.

[jplatte](https://matrix.to/#/@jplatte:matrix.org) offered:

> This week,
>
> * Devin, our GSoC student, [started blogging](https://ruma.dev/news/gsoc-begins-2020/) on ruma.io
>
> * We released [ruma-identifiers 0.16.2](https://github.com/ruma/ruma-identifiers/releases/tag/0.16.2) and ruma-federation-api 0.0.2
> * We started updating ruma-events and ruma-client-api with the changes from version r0.6.1 of the client-server specification
>
> * We started moving all of our libraries into one [monorepo](https://github.com/ruma/ruma)!
>     * As part of this, we introduced a kind of meta-library so you no longer have to keep the versions of the individual libraries in sync manually
>
>     * We're hoping that this makes experiments across multiple libraries and the overall contribution process easier 🙂

## Final Thoughts 💭

There are bounties to be had! [AU$500 to support Emoji Reactions in Fractal](https://www.wezm.net/v2/posts/2020/bounties/), for reference this is tracked [on the GNOME gitlab](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/fractal/-/issues/530).

We didn't hear from Spectral *too* recently, but there are [signs of code being written](https://gitlab.com/spectral-im/spectral/-/commits/qt5-15).

This week I've been chatting with conference organisers making really
interesting virtual event plans, and I'm bursting to share some of the Matrix
integration plans, hopefully more details coming soon.
