### matrix-media-repo

[TravisR](https://github.com/turt2live) told us:

> matrix-media-repo has early support for IPFS! Currently it's only gateway support, but in the coming days it should be possible to also upload into the IPFS world. See <https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo/issues/115#issuecomment-593772429> for details.

### Synapse

[richvdh](https://matrix.to/#/@richvdh:sw1v.org) said:

> A busy week in Synapse this week! We've released Synapse 1.11.1 to fix a security problem with single-sign-on, Patrick has been putting the finishing touches to the room-alias-spam mitigation measures in [MSC2432](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2432), and Erik has been doing some exciting work in replacing the inter-process replication protocol for worker-based deployments.
>
> We've also started the design work on single-sign-on support for user-interactive-auth, which we'll be starting implementation work on next week.

Also:

> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oh hello... is that Synapse replicating data streams using Redis, paving the way to multi-master Synapse clustering for arbitrary horizontal scalability!?! 😍 <a href="https://t.co/E7pcFWQEgC">pic.twitter.com/E7pcFWQEgC</a></p>&mdash; Matrix (@matrixdotorg) <a href="https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/1235968592778276866?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 6, 2020</a>

## Synapse Deployment 📥

### multi arch synapse docker image

[Black Hat](https://matrix.to/#/@bhat:encom.eu.org) announced:

> I finally remembered to update my [multi arch synapse docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/black0/synapse/) to 1.11.0. Now with more architectures!

### Docker-matrix

[Mathijs](https://matrix.to/#/@mathijs:matrix.vgorcum.com) offered:

> The image for synapse 1.11.1 is now available as [avhost/docker-matrix:v1.11.1](https://hub.docker.com/r/avhost/docker-matrix) and [mvgorcum/docker-matrix:v1.11.1](https://hub.docker.com/r/mvgorcum/docker-matrix). As always these images use jemalloc and mjolnir anti-spam.

## Dept of Bridges 🌉

### mx-puppet-slack

[sorunome](https://matrix.to/#/@sorunome:sorunome.de) said:

> mx-puppet-slack supports `xoxc` tokens now! That means you are able to bridge slack workspaces without the need of legacy tokens or oauth - no permission from the workspace admins are required for those!

### mx-puppet-bridge

[mx-puppet-bridge](https://github.com/Sorunome/mx-puppet-bridge) is a general bridging library that supports (double)bridging and relays. The goal is to make it as easy as possible for others to bridge new third-party protocols to matrix. [Support room](https://matrix.to/#/#mx-puppet-bridge:sorunome.de) [Donate](https://liberapay.com/Sorunome)

[sorunome](https://matrix.to/#/@sorunome:sorunome.de) offered:

> * Added optional parsing of file metadata (filling in the `info` block) for images, video and audio (requires `ffprobe` to be installed)
> * Adding advanced relays --> protocol implementations can e.g. use webhooks to display relayed messages more nicely
> * Add userlist syncing options for rooms
>
> #### mx-puppet-discord
>
> * Use the advanced relay to bridge relay messages using webhooks
> * Implement userlist syncing: The userlist on matrix now accurately reflects the discord members in that room

### Mumble Bridge

There is a simple [Mumble-Matrix Bridge](https://github.com/mymindstorm/matrix-appservice-mumble) available.

> A simple Matrix to Mumble bridge. It sends messages between bridged rooms and tells you when people join / leave Murmur.

Written in TypeScript and based on [matrix-appservice-bridge](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge).

The creator, [mymindstorm](https://matrix.to/#/@mymindstorm:evermiss.net) said:

> Hello again, I made a public room at [#mumble-bridge:evermiss.net](https://matrix.to/#/#mumble-bridge:evermiss.net)

## Dept of Clients 📱

### gomuks

[Tulir](https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net) announced:

> gomuks now supports sending replies, reactions and redactions with commands. You can either run the command (e.g. `/react 👍️`) first and then select the message with up/down arrows and enter, or you can click on a message to select it first and then run the command.

### Ditto v0.3.0 Release

### RiotX

[benoit](https://matrix.to/#/@benoit.marty:matrix.org) said:

> We have fixed several errors on file and media sending/downloading/sharing. Also we are still working on cross-signing and e2e stabilization.

### Riot-iOS

[Manu](https://matrix.to/#/@Manu:matrix.org) said:

> Riot-iOS: We have fixed an issue with push notifications but we are still investigating rageshake logs before doing the release. In parallel, we are still working on cross-signing: QR code and Secret Sharing.

### Nheko

[Nheko](https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko) is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE (with the notable exception being device verification for now) and intends to be full featured and nice to look at

[Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)](https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev) reported:

> * We welcomed adasauce as an official member to the Nheko project on Github! Adasauce has been working on a lot of the smaller annoyances and layout issues.
> * Adasauce started working on configuring what events get shown in the timeline on a per room or account wide basis.
> * We have merged the dev branch to master, because it confused a lot of people. If your packages use 0.7.0-dev, now is the time to switch
> * red_sky merged the dev branch and started updating everything, that depends on this branch. This includes the AUR package and our Weblate instance (for translations).
> * Nheko now has experimental support for MSC2448. This adds a blurry preview for images (and videos) sent via nheko directly into the event body (at the cost of ~30 bytes). This considerably reduces latency until clients show something, that isn't an empty box, to preview media, since downloading the media over federation and generating a thumbnail has positive latency.
> * Avatars should now not be blurry when using display scaling. Please report, if this is still happening to you (in the timeline or room list, there is a known issue with the user profile dialog and servers that don't do dynamic thumbnailing)
> * Misc fixes and translation updates from multiple contributors.

### Various Riot-theme news

[Dylan](https://matrix.to/#/@dhmf:m.dhdf.dev) told us:

> Selenized Light, Dark, and Black for Riot!
> If you have your own build of riot-web you can simply modify the config.json and add this theme to it!
>
> * GitHub: <https://github.com/aaronraimist/riot-web-themes#selenized-light-theme>

I particularly like the Selenized Dark:

OBS is used for development of the openSUSE distribution and can build packages from the same sources for Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu, SUSE Linux Enterprise and other distributions.
