### Construct

Update from Jason:

> End-to-end encryption support has landed in Construct. The server now supports cross-signing, secret storage, and key backups for clients. I'm pleased with how this all came together on schedule for the upcoming transition to e2ee by default for Matrix. If you haven't been paying attention in [#construct:zemos.net](https://matrix.to/#/#construct:zemos.net) last week full support for push-rules including efficient highlight-counting also landed. Next week Application Service support is scheduled.
>
> Construct is quickly nearing complete coverage over the full breadth of the Matrix protocol, and the transition into release packaging is fast approaching. Construct is the C++ homeserver built for maximum performance with the lowest possible cost of ownership. If you're in need of a faster homeserver please show your support in [#construct:zemos.net](https://matrix.to/#/#construct:zemos.net) and tell all your friends to lend a hand today!

### New Rust Homeserver

[timo](https://matrix.to/#/@timo:koesters.xyz) announced:

> Hello! This week I worked on a Matrix homeserver written in Rust. Registering and logging in works already and I am currently adding support for sending events and inserting them into the event graph. I spent most of my time reading the Matrix specification to understand how this process works, because with federation (which I plan to add to my homeserver in the future) servers might disagree on which event was created first and there are strictly defined rules to resolve this. The Matrix homeserver uses the Ruma libraries as it's base and handles requests and responses using the Rocket crate. I use sled to store information as (key, value) pairs in a database. Most of these libraries are still experimental and I take this attitude myself by straying off from the reference implementations and changing algorithms in hopes of better performance. If you want to help, check out [#rustmatrix:koesters.xyz](https://matrix.to/#/#rustmatrix:koesters.xyz).

### mautrix-asmux

[Tulir](https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net) offered:

> [mautrix-asmux](https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-asmux) wasn't made this week, but I haven't mentioned it on TWIM before. Basically, it acts as a proxy between appservices and the homeserver. The primary point is to make it possible to dynamically provision appservices.
>
> The dynamically provisioned appservices connect to mautrix-asmux with individual access tokens, which asmux checks and then proxies the requests to Synapse with its own global access token. Synapse is only aware of one appservice, which will have a large user ID and alias namespace (e.g. everything starting with `_`). In the other direction, mautrix-asmux maintains a room ID -> appservice mapping, which it uses to send incoming events to the correct appservice. As a side effect, mautrix-asmux implements [MSC2190](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2190), which is needed for end-to-bridge encryption.

### 📡 Sygnal 0.4.0

[Half-Shot](https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk) told us:

> Hey, some non-bridge news from me. We've released [Sygnal v0.4.0](https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal/releases/tag/v0.4.0) which allows folks to use postgresql to store state rather than sqlite3.

...and then...

> another release, <https://github.com/matrix-org/sygnal/releases/tag/v0.4.1>

### Synapse

[Neil](https://matrix.to/#/@neilj:matrix.org) told us:

> We continue on our performance drive. We’ll get Redis into production early next week replacing our home grown TCP based replication system. We also landed some SSO fixes for user interactive auth. Additionally we shipped a bug fix release in [1.12.3](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.12.3).

## Synapse Deployment 📥

### Kubernetes

[Ananace](https://matrix.to/#/@ace:kittenface.studio) offered:

> Just bumped the [K8s-optimized Synapse image](https://github.com/ananace/matrix-synapse) to 1.12.1

### Docker-matrix

[Mathijs](https://matrix.to/#/@mathijs:matrix.vgorcum.com) told us:

> The docker image for synapse v1.12.1rc1 is now on [mvgorcum/docker-matrix:v1.12.1rc1](https://hub.docker.com/r/mvgorcum/docker-matrix/tags)

## Dept of Bridges 🌉

### mautrix-telegram

[Tulir](https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net) said:

> mautrix-telegram now has experimental support for end-to-bridge encryption. It's intended for cases where you don't want the homeserver to have access to messages, e.g. user-hostable appservices. It's currently on the `e2be` branch and should be merged to master soon. You can find setup instructions on the wiki: <https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram/wiki/End‐to‐bridge-encryption>
>
> The same feature will make its way to mautrix-facebook and mautrix-hangouts in the near future. After that, I'm going to start working on porting matrix-nio's crypto code to Go to bring end-to-bridge encryption to mautrix-whatsapp and possibly also general e2ee support for gomuks.

### New tooling for plumbing IRC rooms

[Cos](https://matrix.to/#/@cos:hacklab.fi) announced:

> I got annoyed by how difficult plumbing IRC rooms is and wrote a simple Python script to do it more easily from command line. Also cleaning old rooms and chats in Riot is quite tedious so I added support for easily leaving rooms to the script. I decided to creatively call it matrixtools and created a github repo for it for others to enjoy. It's still in infancy but more features are already planned such as more IRC management stuff and creating tombstone events to point rooms to other rooms. The tool uses Python and matrix-nio library. Contributions welcome! <https://github.com/vranki/matrixtools>

### mx-puppet-bridge

[mx-puppet-bridge](https://github.com/Sorunome/mx-puppet-bridge) is a general bridging library that supports (double)bridging and relays. The goal is to make it as easy as possible for others to bridge new third-party protocols to matrix. [Support room](https://matrix.to/#/#mx-puppet-bridge:sorunome.de) [Donate](https://liberapay.com/Sorunome)

[sorunome](https://matrix.to/#/@sorunome:sorunome.de) said:

> The bridge bot now sends read indicators for messages successfully delivered to the remote network - only supported on protocol implementations with event synchronising. 🦊
>
> #### mx-puppet-slack
>
> Advanced relay support! Similar to the discord bridge, you can now make an advanced relay, where, if in relay mode, the messages from matrix users appear correctly with username+avatar on the slack side. This works for both classic slack apps and new slack apps, via the events API.
>
> For that the underlying slack client connection had to be significantly re-written, which became its own repository.
>
> #### mx-puppet-skype
>
> The skype puppet received a couple of bugfixes, so that it *shouldn't* need to be manually restarted every day anymore.

### mx-puppet-voipms

[mx-puppet-voipms](https://github.com/zoenb/mx-puppet-voipms) is a puppeting bridge for the SMS functionality provided by [voip.ms](https://voip.ms). It is based on [mx-puppet-bridge](https://github.com/Sorunome/mx-puppet-bridge).

[zoe](https://matrix.to/#/@zoe:zoisite.xyz) reported:

> Initial release of mx-puppet-voipms, a puppeting bridge for the voip.ms SMS api built on top of the amazing mx-puppet-bridge framework.

### 🤙 node-jitsi

[Half-Shot](https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk) told us:

> Hey folks! I've not posted a proper bridge update in a while, so let's go into another project that isn't a bridge. I've started working on a new project called [node-jitsi](https://github.com/Half-Shot/node-jitsi), which will allow people to connect their services to Jitsi Meet conferences. It's designed to allow bridges to start bridging across actual calls into Matrix via Jitsi, but could really be used by any project which is Node.JS based and wants Jitsi call functionality. The goal is to keep the interface clean and simple, and do all of the heavy lifting (WebRTC negotiations, XMPP handling) itself.

### Nio for iOS

[kilian](https://matrix.to/#/@kilian:nio.chat) said:

> Nio for iOS has been getting some attention this week. Message display is now much better (visually grouped by sender) and I added some preliminary support for contextual event actions. For the time being emoji reactions and redactions have been implemented. (The context menu does trigger the best result of the visual flipping workaround in SwiftUI though 😅)

### Quotient project

[kitsune](https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org) reported:

> The Quotient project has made two "sustaining" releases this week, and then three^Wfour more to fix foolish mistakes - right on the Fools' Day! Long story short - if you're on Quaternion 0.0.9.4* (with any trailing letter) and, respectively, libQMatrixClient 0.5.x, make sure to upgrade to [Quaternion 0.0.9.4e](https://github.com/quotient-im/Quaternion/releases/tag/0.0.9.4e) and [libQMatrixClient 0.5.3.2](https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/releases/tag/0.5.3.2) because, as of this writing, these are the latest and fixedest in the breed. Aside from many backend bugfixes (mostly described in [release notes from 0.5.3](https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/releases/tag/0.5.3)), this refreshed pair can handle SSO and no more interferes with [Pantalaimon](https://github.com/matrix-org/pantalaimon) in encrypted rooms. Further plans include scrapping the whole Quotient thing and switch to Python because it's so much easier. Just kidding :) the plans didn't change, Quotient 0.6 is the next milestone, and the backend for the next Quaternion release. And you won't need to wait another year for them, I promise.

### Mirage

[miruka](https://matrix.to/#/@miruka:matrix.org) reported:

> [Mirage 0.4.3 was released today](https://github.com/mirukana/mirage/releases/tag/v0.4.3), AppImage and Flatpak included.
>
> Some of the most notable changes: 
>
> * **Redactions support**: individual or selected messages can now be removed from the context menu or using keyboard shortcuts
>
> * New shortcuts for inviting to, leaving or forgetting a room
> * Support for environment variables to specify config and user data folders
>
> * Fixed the crash after login for KDE users

### Riot Web

[Ryan](https://matrix.to/#/@jryans:matrix.org) announced:

> Riot Web 1.5.14 and 1.5.15 were released this week with a simpler Jitsi integration, new keyboard shortcuts (along with shortcut help via `Cmd / Ctrl+/`), and layout performance fixes. 1.5.14 has a security issue with the Jitsi widget wrapper, so please remove any copies of 1.5.14 if you installed it. Lots of cross-signing polish work continues as we get closer to release.

### Riot-iOS

[Manu](https://matrix.to/#/@Manu:matrix.org) announced:

> We made a hot fix release ([0.10.5](https://github.com/vector-im/riot-ios/releases/tag/v0.10.5)) this week. Cross-signing work is still progressing well. We will run much more tests next week with other Riots to finish the feature.

>
> * [ruma-client-api 0.7.0](https://github.com/ruma/ruma-client-api/releases/tag/0.7.0)
>
>   * This release once again gets us closer to r0.6.0 compatibility
>
>   * We now use the standard libraries `Duration` type for a few things including the `/sync` request's `timeout` parameter
>   * We now have an `Error` type that error responses from the homeserver will be deserialized into

### New PHP library

[a_v_p](https://matrix.to/#/@a_v_p:matrix.org) announced:

> Hello!  I'm working on a PHP library (GPL v3.0+) that allows to communicate with a Matrix instance.  Currently the library allows to create users, rooms, login to the Matrix server and send messages, although more work needs to be done: <https://github.com/artyom-poptsov/matrix-php>
>
> I created the library due to my own needs, but probably it will be of some interest for others.

Apparently the author has a need for Matrix-Moodle integration, sounds interesting! An update! Late breaking:

> I've updated Matrix-PHP, now there's documentation in `README.md` on how to use the library.  If anyone wants to use it/contribute, this should make the things easier.
>
> There's no release yet though.  But for now, the library is capable of: 
> - creating users with on the servers where registration is disabled;
> - changing users passwords (by users themselves or by admins);
> - logging in to the server using `m.login.password` method;
> - sending text messages to rooms;
> - checking if a username is available for registration on a server (only for admins.)

## Dept of Bots 🤖

### CovBot

[Peter Roberts](https://matrix.to/#/@pwr22:shortestpath.dev) said:

> Lives in the cloud now so should be more reliable.

Fairly sure Peter is referring to [his tracking bot](https://github.com/pwr22/covbot) being on new hosting. He *could* mean that he has ascended to the clouds, and is therefore more reliable, but perhaps he wouldn't have posted to TWIM in that case.

### dice bot

[Tulir](https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net) told us:

> The maubot [dice plugin](https://github.com/maubot/dice) got a new release. The primary change was a config option to show results of individual rolls.

### OBS bot v0.5

### Swedish government launching a three-day remote hackathon

[Ananace](https://matrix.to/#/@ace:kittenface.studio) reported:

> Maybe more tangentically relevant, but the Swedish government is launching a [three-day remote hackathon](https://www.hackthecrisis.se/) starting tomorrow (3rd-6th of April) focusing on saving lives, communities, and businesses. A Matrix solution may very well be interesting to develop for this, perhaps something taking another look at the CoAP/CBOR work.
