Some snapshots of what the team has been working on. Look out for a clear explanation from Erik about Synapse performance (and what will be done about it!), and lots of other goodies

## Dept of *Status of Matrix* 🌡

### Tchap used by French fire and rescue services

[Brendan](https://matrix.to/#/@brendan:abolivier.bzh) announced:

> Tchap, the Matrix deployment in the French government, recently opened to French fire and rescue services: <https://twitter.com/_DINUM/status/1243595481449717761>
>
> Rescue18 (a French non-governmental news website for emergency services) [echoed this announcement](https://rescue18.fr/actu/tchap-lapplication-de-messagerie-de-letat-maintenant-disponible-pour-les-sapeurs-pompiers/) earlier this month, praising the security aspect of the platform and the possibility it offers to improve social and professional exchanges throughout the hierarchy as well as the rest of the government and public services.

Article is all in some other language - thanks Brendan for providing this summary.

## Dept of Spec 📜

[anoa](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz) said:

## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Synapse

[Neil](https://matrix.to/#/@neilj:matrix.org) said:

> Last week
>
>  * Shipped [1.12.4](https://matrix.org/blog/2020/04/23/synapse-1-12-4-released) a patch release to fix some cross signing related bugs. 
>  * Redis support to replace our existing cross replication system, merged to develop. This is a precursor to the sharding project. We have a PR to support cache invalidation across workers which, once merged should make it relatively easy to pull off event persistence from the master process. Just removing event persistence could give some decent perf wins, but the prize is then splitting persistence to run across across multiple workers.
>
>  * A final PR to support SSO for user interactive auth will merge imminently, thereby freeing up full cross signing support for worker installs. 
>  * Aside from that we’ve been working on fixing a weird bug where rooms can end up with zero forward extremities and generally showing Sygnal some love. 
>
> Upcoming
>
>  * Put Redis into production
>  * Ship 1.13.0 which will contain Redis support as well as a host of SSO bug fixes.
>
>  * Merge our new caching config logic to give finer granularity on cache settings.
>  * Merge cache invalidation and try to get events persistence running in its own worker.

Ben added:

> Cross signing, oh cross signing! Can you believe it‽ Cross signing!!!

### Matrix Corporal

[matrix-corporal](https://github.com/devture/matrix-corporal) manages your Matrix server according to a configuration policy

[Slavi](https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com) reported:

> [matrix-corporal](https://github.com/devture/matrix-corporal) v1.9.0 has been released. It adds support for preventing certain users from creating rooms (that is, from using the `/createRoom` API). I've been thinking about developing this feature for a while now, as people have been requesting it frequently.

### matrix-media-repo

[matrix-media-repo](https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo) is a highly customizable multi-domain media repository for Matrix

[TravisR](https://github.com/turt2live) announced:

> v1.1.2 is out with a bunch of fixes to the Docker image. Check out <https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo/releases/tag/v1.1.2> for details, and #media-repo:t2bot.io for support.

### Conduit

Conduit is a Matrix homeserver written in Rust <https://conduit.rs>

[timo](https://matrix.to/#/@timo:koesters.xyz) told us:

> Conduit is a Matrix homeserver written in Rust <https://conduit.rs>
>
> This week I worked a lot on getting the first bit of federation working. My goal was to query the public room list of another server and forward it to a client.
>
> This involved setting up a keypair to sign the json I send to the server and putting authorization headers into my requests. Most of the work is already done and <https://federationtester.matrix.org/> reports it's all good.

![2020-04-24-I3XIM-image.png](/blog/img/2020-04-24-I3XIM-image.png)

> Sadly there seems to be a problem with the signing, because other homeservers reject requests: `Unable to verify signature: <class 'nacl.exceptions.BadSignatureError'> Signature was forged or corrupt`. I'll continue to work on this in the next week(s).
>
> Thanks to my supporters on [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/timokoesters).

### Dendrite / gomatrixserverlib

Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go

[Neil Alexander](https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org) said:

> * Dendrite now supports perspective key fetching as a configurable option, and will automatically attempt to use the perspective key servers for keys that couldn't be fetched directly
>
> * Dendrite now uses a newer version of the Sarama library
> * Some caching has been added to the roomserver API for room versions, which should help quite a bit with performance over federation and handling transactions
>
> * Auth checks for `/send_join` are now quite a bit more robust
> * A bug has been fixed where the default state filter limited the amount of room state that was visible after a join
>
> * gomatrixserverlib has quite a bit of new support for backfilling now, which will be wired into Dendrite soon
> * gomatrixserverlib has new primitives for v2 invite responses and `/get_missing_events` requests
>
> * Invite support is being worked on currently, which should also enable support for creating DMs in Riot

[Tulir](https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net) announced:

> gomuks got a fancy initial sync loading bar so it no longer looks like it's broken after you log in. Implementing end-to-end encryption in mautrix-go has also been slowly progressing, might have something working in a few weeks.

### Riot Web

A glossy Matrix collaboration client for the web. <https://riot.im>

[Ryan](https://matrix.to/#/@jryans:matrix.org) offered:

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰

### matrix-spring-boot-sdk

[Benedict](https://matrix.to/#/@benedict:imbitbu.de) told us:

> I created an client-sdk to interact with matrix in Spring Boot. It is written in kotlin and should also work with Java. You can find the repo here: <https://github.com/benkuly/matrix-spring-boot-sdk>
>
> It contains also a bot-sdk to write bots by adding a dependency and a few lines of code only.
> It is tested with unit-tests, but integration-tests against a real matrix-server are currently missing. A simple ping bot works and is also integrated in the repo as example.
>
> Currently I'm working on getting this to Maven Central.
