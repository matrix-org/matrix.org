## Dept of *Status of Matrix* 🌡

### Meetup Event in London

This week Matrix held a Meetup Event in London! There were presentations demonstrating E2E Cross-Signing (including the next, sleeker QR codes), P2P in the browser with Dendrite, Message retention, and Github bridging. There was also plenty of P2E* and B2D**.

You can catch up on what was missed by watching [this week's Matrix Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zdn1MQIg03s) (below), or check out the [full event playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl5dnxRMP1hVQkNy2RPJfSnDkwRqaxo_R), particularly the [P2P with Dendrite demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwlqQ6G5TZ8).

### Google Summer of Code

Last week we announced that Google had selected Matrix for the Google Summer of Code progamme, and requested projects get involved under the Matrix banner. We had a great response to this call: Ditto, Ruma, opsdroid and Nheko are all offering projects this year, as well as projects under the core Matrix team.

We updated [suggested projects list](http://matrix-org.github.io/gsoc/#/projects) (more to come), so if you're a student please take a look. Think about what you'd like to work on, get involved with suggested projects, and join [#gsoc:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#gsoc:matrix.org) to discuss.

## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Dendrite / gomatrixserverlib

[Neil Alexander](https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org) told us:

> * Experimental support for state res v2 (and, by extension, room version 2) is now in a PR and undergoing testing
> * The hashing algorithm has been fixed which improves federation reliability with Synapse
> * A significant number of SQLite bugs have been fixed and we now have the ability to run Sytest against Dendrite in SQLite mode
> * Kegan has been doing great work on building Dendrite for WASM and running it in the browser as a Service Worker!
> * Sending EDUs in transactions with no PDUs has been fixed, which also seems to fix sending outbound typing notifications

### Sydent

[Brendan](https://matrix.to/#/@brendan:abolivier.bzh) announced:

> Sydent v2.0.0 has just been released! 🎉
>
> The biggest changes in this release are [the privacy improvements](https://matrix.org/blog/2019/09/27/privacy-improvements-in-synapse-1-4-and-riot-1-4) we've worked on last year, along with Python 3 support and improved documentation.
>
> More details can be found in the [full changelog](https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/blob/v2.0.0/CHANGELOG.md), and folks can get their hands on this new version from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/matrix-sydent/2.0.0/) or from [GitHub](https://github.com/matrix-org/sydent/releases/tag/v2.0.0) 🙂

### matrix-media-repo v1.0.1 patch

[TravisR](https://github.com/turt2live) reported:

> matrix-media-repo got a v1.0.1 patch release to fix a memory leak. Downloads and the very small changelog available at <https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-media-repo/releases/tag/v1.0.1>

### Matrixmon v0.5.0

[jaywink](https://matrix.to/#/@jaywink:federator.dev) said:

> [Matrixmon](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrixmon), the perl based c2s probe with metrics to track your Synapse server client API responses is now at v0.5.0 and now allows using an access_token for the probe user.

### Synapse

[anoa](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz) reported:

> This week Erik  been tackling the work on sharding the master process in Synapse, Patrick  has been working on the new room alias semantics while richvdh  has been doing some background preparation to allow us to change the way events are redacted in future room versions.
>
> Next week: SSO/User Interactive auth is still in the pipeline, alongside an option to allow users to change their password without logging out their other devices, and of course, more sharding.

## Dept of Ops 🛠

### arm64 support for all [Tulir](https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net)-projects:

> The docker images of my projects (specifically mautrix-{telegram,whatsapp,facebook,hangouts} bridges, maubot and mautrix-manager) now support arm64 in addition to amd64. They're multiarch images, so the same tag will work with both architectures.

## Dept of Clients 📱

### Nheko

[Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)](https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev) offered:

> * adasauce fixed the settings page to properly display on narrow screens, like the PinePhone or Librem5
> * We fixed rooms being stuck on unread. This only applies for rooms, where you receive an event after you updated.
> * Avatars should now render in high res on high dpi screen with display scaling enabled.
> * We fixed some smaller annoyances regarding what happens, when clicking elements of replies and the reply button now only shows on hover (or tap on the right side, like the timestamp, on mobile)
> * We fixed the logic around user interactive authentication needed for registration, which means you should be able to register on servers using recaptcha and other registration requirements again! Note that this currently doesn't seem to work on servers, that use workers. This may be because of [a synapse bug](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/6705), but the jury is still out, it may still be our fault ;-)
> * We wrote some [proposals for GSoC](https://matrix-org.github.io/gsoc/#/projects), which Nheko was invited to participate in under the matrix.org umbrella.
> * Someone packaged [Nheko for Guix](https://guix.gnu.org/packages/nheko-0.6.4/)!

#### Nheko in Guix

That "someone" was [nixo](https://matrix.to/#/@nixo:nixo.xyz):

> [nheko-reborn](https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko) is now available on the [guix](https://guix.gnu.org/packages/nheko-0.6.4/) package manager!
> Guix feature [reproducible builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/), allowing users to verify the binary cache correctness, and the possibility to create tarball/docker images
> to easily share the build results with all dependencies to systems without guix package manager.
>
> Guix also aims at reducing bootstrap binaries to a minimum (see [this blog post](https://guix.gnu.org/blog/2019/guix-reduces-bootstrap-seed-by-50/) for example), reducing the effect of [trusting trust attacks](https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/hh/thompson/trust.html).  Those properties led guix to be the package manager of choice for [bitcoin development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2iShmUTEl8).

### Riot Themes

Last week [Aaron](https://matrix.to/#/@aaron:raim.ist) said:

> I made a place where you can post Riot Web themes <https://github.com/aaronraimist/riot-web-themes>

Which like the flap of a butterfly wing has caused a series of events:

#### A Nord Theme for Riot!

[Dylan](https://matrix.to/#/@dhmf:m.dhdf.dev) announced:

> If you have your own build of riot-web you can simply modify the config.json and add this theme to it!
>
> * GitHub: <https://github.com/aaronraimist/riot-web-themes#nord-theme>

#### A wild Discord themed Riot has appeared!

[Dylan](https://matrix.to/#/@dhmf:m.dhdf.dev) reported:

> If you have your own build of riot-web you can simply modify the config.json and add this theme to it!
>
> * GitHub: <https://github.com/aaronraimist/riot-web-themes#discord-dark-theme>

![2020-02-28-As3g2-image.png](/blog/img/2020-02-28-As3g2-image.png)

### matrix-docker-ansible-deploy support

[Slavi](https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com) reported:

> [matrix-docker-ansible-deploy](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy) now makes it easy to install custom riot-web themes, either by having you manually define them or by automatically pulling whatever themes are available in [aaronraimist/riot-web-themes](https://github.com/aaronraimist/riot-web-themes). To learn more, take a look at our [riot-web documentation on Themes](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/master/docs/configuring-playbook-riot-web.md#themes).

### Fractal 

[Alexandre Franke](https://matrix.to/#/@afranke:matrix.org) announced:

> Our current Outreachy intern implemented many nice media related things. Videos now have a preview playing directly in the room history and clicking on them opens a player view with the usual controls. 

{{ youtube_player(video_id="ooGdsdsiCMg") }} 

> Audio messages have a nicer presentation too. The audio player downloads the whole file to make seeking possible. 
>
> The narrow view (used e.g. on the Pinephone and Librem 5) gained a new swipe-back gesture to go back from room to room list



### gomuks

[Tulir](https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net) said:

> gomuks now has support for lazy-loading room members, which might mean that small servers won't explode when gomuks does an initial sync.

### RiotX 0.17.0

[benoit](https://matrix.to/#/@benoit.marty:matrix.org) reported:

> RiotX: We have released version 0.17.0: new attachment management, with media preview and edition. This release also contains a lot of bug fixes. We are also still working on cross-signing implementation.

### Riot iOS

[steve](https://matrix.to/#/@stevio:matrix.org) told us:

> This week we continued to implement verification by QR code at application and SDK level.

## Dept of Interesting Projects 🛰

### Matrix Notepad

[KB1RD](https://matrix.to/#/@kb1rd:kb1rd.net) offered:

> **Finally,** version `0.2.0` is here, which...
> * Introduces the new version of `logootish-js`
> * Gets ready for conflict resolution systems
> * Fixes *some* (but not all) bugs encountered (thanks to the new algo)
> * Removes the debug panel in favor of native browser console based debug

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰

### nio template

[anoa](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz) told us:

> ...is a template repo based on the [matrix-nio](https://github.com/poljar/matrix-nio) library that you can use to get quickly up and running with making simple, yet powerful matrix bots in Python!
>
> 🔒️ Encryption Support is now built-in 🎉! This does shift the login model from access token to username/password. Note that by entering a device id however, you won't be creating a new device every time you start up the bot!
>
> Other notable fixes:
>
> * `/sync` is no longer spammed! This should take some load off of your homeserver.
> * Config file parsing is a lot simpler now by way of a `_get_cfg` method, which allows you to easily device down into yaml dictionaries, set default values, mark whether a config value is required etc.
>
> Thanks to alturiak for motivating me to make these changes :)
>
> The repo is <https://github.com/anoadragon453/nio-template>, and room is [#nio-template:amorgan.xyz](https://matrix.to/#/#nio-template:amorgan.xyz).

## Dept of Bridges 🌉

### mx-puppet-bridge

[sorunome](https://matrix.to/#/@sorunome:sorunome.de) told us:

> [mx-puppet-bridge](https://github.com/Sorunome/mx-puppet-bridge) received a few additions:
>
> * [tulir](https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net) made [a PR](https://github.com/Sorunome/mx-puppet-bridge/pull/27) to add a provisioning API - said PR is already merged. Thanks a lot!
> * Way better relay mode: You can now configure individual puppets to be a relay rather than a puppet. Additionally you can configure default room visibility and autoinvite.
> * Don't unbridge a room on leaving anymore - it will remain bridged. You can get invites to rooms via the new `invite` command. With the knock MSC it will also be possible to get an invite via a knock.
>
> If you have any questions, please join our [support chat](https://matrix.to/#/[#mx-puppet-bridge:sorunome.de](https://matrix.to/#/#mx-puppet-bridge:sorunome.de)) and maybe consider to [donate](https://liberapay.com/Sorunome). Thank you!
>
> #### mx-puppet-slack
>
> [tulir](https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net) made [a PR](https://github.com/Sorunome/mx-puppet-slack/pull/36) for custom provisioning API endpoints. It is already merged. Thanks a lot!
>
> #### mx-puppet-tox
>
> [mx-puppet-tox](https://github.com/Sorunome/mx-puppet-tox) is finally functional again! It is updated to the latest mx-puppet-bridge library, giving it all the new features. Yay!

## Dept of Bots 🤖

### Hemppa the bot

[Cos](https://matrix.to/#/@cos:hacklab.fi) reported:

> Hemppa the bot gained ability to run shell commands via Matrix. It's a small feature but enables a lot of possibilities in system management and monitoring, home automation, and whatever you can do in linux shell.  As an example project I plan to use it for running a script to open hackerspace door with Raspberry Pi's GPIO if sender is a member. <https://github.com/vranki/hemppa>

### remindbot the bot

[stefan](https://matrix.to/#/@rumpelsepp:hackbrettl.de) announced:

> [remindbot](https://git.sr.ht/~rumpelsepp/remindbot) got support for reacting when mentioned. This allows the bot to be used in rooms with more than 2 participants. The timespec got a minor update, supporting now the variant `tomorrow HH:MM`. Furthermore, the bot now sends a reaction when a notification has been scheduled instead of a noisy message.

## Dept of Ping 🏓

Here we reveal, rank, and applaud the homeservers with the lowest ping, as measured by [pingbot](https://github.com/maubot/echo), a [maubot](https://github.com/maubot/maubot) that you can host on your own server.
