## Dept of GSoC 🎓️

This week was the first evaluations, we'll have results to share next week.

### matrix-ircd (GSOC)

[karlik](https://matrix.to/#/@karlik:matrix.org) offered:

> for matrix-ircd:
>
> * Removed `futures` 0.1 dependency & move all modules to `futures` 0.3
>
> * Update all tests to use async / await
> * Begin merging updated `futures` to `async_await` branch

### go-neb

From [nikofil](https://matrix.to/#/@nikofil:matrix.org):

> * e2ee merged and some bugs fixed (pr #324)! You should be able to use neb normally in an encrypted room now, if that's not the case please let us know!
> * Added integration tests for both encrypted and unencrypted rooms to neb in order to catch things that might break some core functionality in a subtle way (issue #326)
> * Similarly, created a PR for mautrix-go for testing the Olm and Megolm session establishment and message encryption / decryption (pr #12)
> * Next up, working on a service for neb for testing the crypto functionality of other clients: neb will send messages to a room, rotate keys etc. and your client is supposed to respond!

## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Dendrite / gomatrixserverlib

Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go

[Neil Alexander](https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org) said:

> This week has seen some new architectural changes and a number of bugs fixed:
>
> * A new Current State Server component has been added, which tracks room state
>
> * The Public Rooms API has been deprecated in favour of the Current State Server
> * Event size limits are now honoured with the correct return code
>
> * Invites have seen some refactoring and retiring invites should work better now
> * The federation sender now persists unsent PDUs to the database and will automatically retry when Dendrite is restarted, making resend behaviour much more reliable (particularly in the P2P demos)
>
> * Some room checks in `/state` and `/state_ids` have been fixed
> * Some additional restrictions have been added to `/send` and we now return the correct error codes
>
> * A bug where current state was incorrectly used when getting missing/backfill events has been fixed
> * A bug where you couldn't rejoin a room that you created after wiping your database has been fixed
>
> Spec compliance:
>
> * Client-Server APIs: 45%
>
> * Server-Server APIs: 50%

### Conduit

Meanwhile, we're also preparing a [1.16 release](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.16.0rc2) with the normal round of bugfixes and incremental improvements.
>
> The big focus in the Synapse team continues to be on performance for larger Synapse instances, which is reflected in the support in 1.16 for running multiple media worker processes. We're working on giving other worker processes the same treatment, so expect more of the same in the weeks to come!

>
> * Matrix API tokens are redacted in logs for better privacy when submitting bug reports.

The changelog can be read here <https://github.com/vector-im/riotX-android/releases/tag/v0.91.3-beta.> And this week we are working on implementing what's remain on our list, and we are fixing as many bugs as we can before the great release.

[anoa](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz) offered:

> The release, v0.1.0, of matrix-reminder-bot is out!  🎉
>
> I've eliminated most of the bad bugs that were present, so will be doing some feature development for a bit. As of now, the features of the bot are:
>
> * Setting reminders
>
> * Have a reminder ping yourself or the whole room
> * Alarms which continue ringing until silenced

>
> Enjoy! ❤️

### IPFS Bot

[MTRNord](https://matrix.to/#/@mtrnord:nordgedanken.dev) offered:

> Did you ever have the issue that a media event sent from someone is too large for your HS and you don't want to fiddle with the link?
>
> IPFS Bot might be a solution. Invite @ipfs:nordgedanken.dev or Check out <https://github.com/MTRNord/matrix-ipfs-bot/> to use the bot.
>
> If you reply to any media event with `!ipfs` the bot will send you a link to the media stored on ipfs.
>
> Known issues are:
>
> * E2EE not yet working (It joins but can't yet decrypt the related event)
>
> * Error handling is basically not existent. Therefore crashes might happen until I sort this out.
> * It currently does very verbose logging. This will be removed when the bot is more stable
>
> * Images sent from RiotX sometimes seem to not play nice with ruma
>
> (Demo for the IPFS Bot): <https://ipfs.nordgedanken.dev/ipfs/QmSfde3V4QL1Lv96Ar62qgnhaEtyi9jzPkKRCBMh4Wqm6F?filename=2020-06-27_16-41-09.mp4>

We could include this video here, but it seems me appropriate to link to an actual IPFS location.

### cody, REPL for your Matrix chat rooms

[carl](https://matrix.to/#/@carl:bordum.dk) offered:

> Hello, I am announcing my first matrix bot - cody - that will evaluate code snippets in your Matrix rooms and return the result. Here is an example interaction:
>
> ```txt
>
> user> !py "Hello world!"
> cody> 'Hello world!'
>
> user> !py list(range(10))
> cody> [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
>
> ```
>
> You can chat with him @cody:bordum.dk and view the source code at <https://gitlab.com/carlbordum/matrix-cody>
>
> This initial release only supports Python, but the plan is to add support for more languages in the next few weeks. The repo might also be of interest to some of you as it has CI, CD to DockerHub, complete dev environment with cody, pantalaimon, synapse and riot using docker-compose, simple metrics and Grafana-dashboards-as-code.

## Dept of Interesting Projects 🛰️

### Matrix Notepad Version `v0.2.2`

[KB1RD](https://matrix.to/#/@kb1rd:kb1rd.net) told us:

> > A real-time collaborative text editor using the Matrix protocol.
>
> [matrix-notepad.kb1rd.net](https://matrix-notepad.kb1rd.net/)
>
> Nope, it's not dead.
>
> * New version of `logootish-js` with a completely new algorithm
>
>     * In particular, I should note that this new algorithm is tested extensively, so I think the bugs should be out
>
> * Corresponding updates to internal event structure
>
> * Fixed UI & CSS bugs
> * Improved UX for room title editor
>
> * Currently, conflicting text will be displayed, but conflicts will not be indicated in any way
> * I almost forgot to mention: The room list is now filtered using the typed rooms MSC (event ID `org.matrix.msc1840`). #test-document0:kb1rd.net is a room with that state event set.
>
> I also made a flame graph of the internal algorithm and I'm surprised by some of the results. The good thing is that I think there's quite a few ways to speed up the algorithm. Here it is:
