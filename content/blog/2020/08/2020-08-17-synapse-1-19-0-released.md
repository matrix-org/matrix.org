Synapse 1.19.0 is here and ready for action.

1.19.0 contains lots of async/await changes, 27 separate PRs to be precise(thanks Patrick). These changes will provide some level of performance improvement, but the real value to us is that it will improve our ability to profile Synapse more effectively.

It also features improved logging performance, this is in part to reduce IO but also to reduce the total amount logged. Weâ€™d be really interested to get some feedback on if the changes help. You may also want to take a look at our new logging defaults to see if they would help reduce total disk space usage.

Some admins will rejoice that we have added a ```/health``` end point to every configured HTTP listener which should make it easier to monitor multi-worker installs.

Finally 1.19.0 contains improvements to the Admin API allowing the admin to optionally purge rooms on deletion.

Get the new releases from any of the usual sources mentioned at <https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/INSTALL.md>. 1.19.0 is on github [here](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.19.0).

Changelog for 1.19.0 follows:

## Synapse 1.19.0 (2020-08-17)

### Removal warning

As outlined in the [previous release](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.18.0), we are no longer publishing Docker images with the `-py3` tag suffix. On top of that, we have also removed the `latest-py3` tag. Please see [the announcement in the upgrade notes for 1.18.0](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/develop/UPGRADE.rst#upgrading-to-v1180).
