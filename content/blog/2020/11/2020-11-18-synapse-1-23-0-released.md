> __Reminder:__ On Monday, we will be announcing a denial of service vulnerability which affects Synapse versions prior to 1.20.0. If you have not upgraded recently, please do so.

[Synapse 1.23.0](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.23.0) now available!

For Synapse admins, this release support generating structured logs via the standard logging configuration ([#8607](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8607), [#8685](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8685)). This may require changing your synapse configuration; see the [upgrade notes](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/v1.23.0rc1/UPGRADE.rst#upgrading-to-v1230) for more information.

We've also added many new Admin APIs, contributed by [@dklimpel](https://github.com/dklimpel):

* Add API to get information about uploaded media ([#8647](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8647))
* Add API for local user media statistics ([#8700](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8700))
* Make it possible to delete files that were not used for a defined time ([#8519](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8519))
* Split API for reported events into detail and list endpoints. This is a breaking change to [#8217](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8217) which was introduced in Synapse v1.21.0. Those who already use this API should check their scripts ([#8539](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8539))
* Allow server admins to list users' notification pushers ([#8610](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8610), [#8689](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8689))

Lastly, Synapse 1.23.0 addresses some significant bugs, including regressions in the SQLite-to-PostgreSQL database porting script ([#8729](http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8729), [#8730](http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8730), [#8755](http://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8755)) and an issue which could prevent Synapse from recovering after losing its connection to its database ([#8726](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8726)). Synapse will also reject ACL modifications from clients which would otherwise cause a server to ban itself from a room ([#8708](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8708)).

Installation instructions are available [on GitHub](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/master/INSTALL.md), as is the `v1.23.0` [release tag](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.23.0).

Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including [@chagai95](https://github.com/chagai95) and [@dklimpel](https://github.com/dklimpel).

The full changelog for 1.23.0 is as follows:

## Synapse 1.23.0 (2020-11-18)

This release changes the way structured logging is configured. See the [upgrade notes](UPGRADE.rst#upgrading-to-v1230) for details.

__Note__: We are aware of a trivially exploitable denial of service vulnerability in versions of Synapse prior to 1.20.0. Complete details will be disclosed on Monday, November 23rd. If you have not upgraded recently, please do so.
