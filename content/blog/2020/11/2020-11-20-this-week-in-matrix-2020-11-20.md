### Synapse

[callahad](https://matrix.to/#/@callahad:matrix.org) offered:

> We released Synapse 1.23.0 on Wednesday! Read all about it on the [Matrix Blog](https://matrix.org/blog/2020/11/18/synapse-1-23-0-released). Otherwise, we'd like to highlight a few developments over the past week:
>
> * We're discussing a policy for ending support for old versions of Python and PostgreSQL. If you have opinions, please [let us know on GitHub](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8782).
>
> * Our initial implementation of [MSC2403: Add "knock" feature](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2403) is undergoing review, and will likely land soon.
> * We've been looking at ways to improve the efficiency of state resolution, and Erik has managed to [devise some algorithmic improvements](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8622#issuecomment-729620021) that yield an order of magnitude speedup for a handful of pathologic cases. We hope to have a better idea of how this might work for real world workloads soon.
>
> Lastly, we'd like to take this opportunity to remind you to **please regularly upgrade your Synapse.** Especially if you're not yet on 1.20.0, as we'll be disclosing a denial of service issue which affects older versions on Monday.

### maunium/synapse

[Tulir](https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net) said:

> mewmew wanted to use my fork of Synapse, so I made the changes there configurable (instead of hardcoding to my user ID) and even added a readme to list the features. It might also be useful for other people who want custom room IDs and other fun stuff.
>
> The fork is available at <https://mau.dev/maunium/synapse>

## Homeserver Deployment 📥️

### Kubernetes

[Ananace](https://matrix.to/#/@ace:kittenface.studio) offered:

## Dept of Clients 📱

### Nheko

[Nheko](https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko) is a desktop client using Qt, Boost.Asio and C++17. It supports E2EE (with the notable exception being device verification for now) and intends to be full featured and nice to look at

[Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)](https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev) announced:

> * Profiles should now open again on older versions of Qt.
>
> * I've been slowly rewriting the message are to be qml, to make it easier to do fancy styling. As a result emojis in the emoji-completer are now colorful and the avatars in the username completer now match the avatars used in the timeline. It also open up a few other improvements, like finally sending mentions as links instead of plain text.
> * We have now CI running on our [self hosted gitlab instance](https://nheko.im). We will probably switch of the travis CI, once this is more battle tested. Repositories are now also automatically mirrored between gitlab and github.
>
> * Fixed a bug, where we tried to read the internal world group on your server instead of keeping that to ourself.

### Konheko

[Nico (@deepbluev7:neko.dev)](https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev) offered:

> I released 0.0.3 a few days ago bundling a few smaller improvements like redactions, copying messages and the ability to click on more links as well as some visual cleanups. Nothing radical, but also nothing breaking (I hope).

>
> * **Social login**
>
>     * To make authentication easier, we’ve started initial implementations of SSO in Element, exploring how homeservers & Matrix clients can support multiple SSO providers. Most of the work so far is captured in [MSC2858](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2858).
>

{{ youtube_player(video_id="wpAXR-HYKmI") }}

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰

### Ruma

Ruma is a Rust project to create a comprehensive set of APIs for Matrix. Previously there was a Ruma homeserver project.

[jplatte](https://matrix.to/#/@jplatte:privacytools.io) said:

> Since our last update four weeks ago,
>
> * iinuwa created issues for all of the identity service api endpoints (w/ suggested module names!) 🎉
>
> * I updated lots of enumerated types to allow unspecced values, for future compatibility & robustness
> * Devin R made sure a custom Content-Type in responses overwrites the default rather than creating a duplicate header. [#339](https://github.com/ruma/ruma/pull/339)
>
> * [gnieto](https://github.com/gnieto) fixed a bunch of bugs in ruma-federation-api
> * [Alejandro Domínguez](https://github.com/aledomu) added support for deserializing string power levels (requires the `unstable-synapse-quirks` feature because these events are invalid according to the spec but Synapse used to (?) accept them)

### Ruby SDK

[Ananace](https://matrix.to/#/@ace:kittenface.studio) reported:

> Just released version 2.2.0 of the [Matrix Ruby SDK](https://github.com/ananace/ruby-matrix-sdk) with the help of the community, with this release support for JRuby is improved - though still not perfect, in the higher-level abstraction direct messaging rooms are now exposed for all users - as well as all that the current user has, and the lower-level abstraction sees the addition of the CS API method to get an event context.
>
> And just to reiterate; if you're using the gem - or have questions/comments about it. please do drop into the discussion room at [#ruby-matrix-sdk:kittenface.studio](https://matrix.to/#/#ruby-matrix-sdk:kittenface.studio).

## Dept of Bots 🤖

You can see demos of both bots in this section by watching Matrix Live \o/

### [home-assistant-bot v2.0.0 released](https://gitlab.com/olegfiksel/home-assistant-bot/-/releases/v2.0.0)

[Oleg](https://matrix.to/#/@oleg:fiksel.info) told us:

> Opsdroid bot for triggering home-assistant automations.
>
> #### Changes
>
> * ⚠️  Possible breaking change: [change behavior how messages are matched](https://gitlab.com/olegfiksel/home-assistant-bot/-/issues/4)
>
>     * Before: messages were matched only if a message starts with `!`
>     * In this version: the whole message is matched. This means in v2.0.0 this will work `Hey, please !turnon light1`
>
>         * You can override this by using `^` in the config for. For example: `regex: "^!turnon"`
>     * This allows one bot trigger another. See this TWIM video for details. 😉
>
> * Add [howto for setting up wakeup-light with home-assistant](https://gitlab.com/olegfiksel/home-assistant-bot/-/blob/master/howtos/wake-up-light/README.md)
>
> * Update Opsdroid to v0.19.0
> * Update opsdroid-homeassistant to 0.1.8
>
> * Add `debug` [config parameter](https://gitlab.com/olegfiksel/home-assistant-bot/-/blob/master/sample-config.yaml#L40) to display messages in the chat, that the bot is getting but, maybe, is not processing/matching

[MTRNord](https://matrix.to/#/@mtrnord:nordgedanken.dev) announced:

> As seen in the video I am working at famedly on a bot to track our work hours.
>
> Until this happens the video gives you a sneakpeak on the functions of that bot.
>
> #### Current (implemented) functions
>
> * Tracking of time using `!in` and `!out` commands with forced usage of a description as well as ISO 8601 timestamps.
>
> * Verification if a time is logical based on the known data
> * Saving the times tracked inside of postgresql
>
> * Tracking durations using a `!record` command
> * Responding to only allowed users. (Including ignoring invites if a user is not allowed to use the bot.)
>
> * Using `!delete` to remove entries from the database as needed
>
> #### Planned functions
>
> * Handling of timezones based on users
>
> * `!stats` command which prints you the tracked durations based on a predefined or custom range of time
> * CSV Export based on a defined range
>
> * `!break` command. Putting a break in between a record or a in/out combination.
> * Better handling of multiple !in commands
>
