### Gitter Enters the Matrix

[Half-Shot](https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk) reported:

> Gitter is joining the Matrix ecosystem!

It's true! Element has acquired Gitter from GitLab and will be implementing
Gitter's current chat features in Matrix, before rebuilding Gitter as a Matrix
client! Before all that however, the first step is to build a proper, modern
bridge between the two networks, replacing the old one that's been around for
years.

The full spectrum of news is:

* [The Matrix.org blog post](https://matrix.org/blog/2020/09/30/welcoming-gitter-to-matrix)
* [The Element blog post](https://element.io/blog/gitter-is-joining-element/)
* [The Gitter blog post](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/09/30/gitter-moves-to-element)
* [Techcrunch article](https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/30/element-acquires-gitter-to-get-more-developers-on-board-with-the-open-matrix-messaging-protocol/)
* [ChangeLog Podcast episode w/ Matthew Hodgson from Matrix and Sytse "Sid" Sijbrandij from GitLab](https://changelog.com/podcast/414)

And if you'd like to chat with your fellow Matrix and Gitter users, there's a
bridged room already set up at
[#gitter:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#gitter:matrix.org)!

Welcome to the community, Gitter! 🎉

## Dept of Spec 📜

[anoa](https://matrix.to/#/@andrewm:amorgan.xyz) reported:

### Matrix URIs

[kitsune](https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org) told us:

> being totally shook up about the Gitter announcement for a good part of the week, I completed the work on [MSC2312](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/issues/2312) (it's about Matrix URIs, ICYMI) and it hopefully won't be long before it becomes the actual standard to share Matrix coordinates in popular web browsers. Ok, who am I kidding - before Matrix clients get on with adoption.

This will allow people to post links to Matrix rooms/messages/users and when clicked will open right in your favourite Matrix client. Super convenient and great for adoption!

## Dept of P2P 👥

### iOS P2P Demo

Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go. It is currently serving as the basis for peer-to-peer Matrix experiments

[Neil Alexander](https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org) announced:

> Build 38 of the iOS P2P Demo, as built using Element iOS and Dendrite, has been submitted to TestFlight and will hopefully be available for testers shortly (pending Apple approval)! It features lots of updates in the Dendrite backend which should hopefully make it more reliable.
>
> If you have an iPhone or iPad and enjoy things that sometimes work, [join the TestFlight here](https://testflight.apple.com/join/Tgh2MEk6)!

## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Synapse

[Neil](https://matrix.to/#/@neilj:matrix.org) reported:

> This week we put out a new release candidate -[1.21.0rc2](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.21.0rc2)
>
> Highlights include
>
> * Add experimental support for sharding event persister. ([\#8294](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8294), [\#8387](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8387), [\#8396](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8396), [\#8419](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8419))

> * Add prometheus metrics to track federation delays. ([\#8430](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8430))
>
> * Fix messages not being sent over federation until an event is sent into the same room. ([\#8230](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8230), [\#8247](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8247), [\#8258](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8258), [\#8272](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8272), [\#8322](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/8322))

>
> Aside from that we are working on moving background processes away from the main process, actually getting the event persister sharding onto matrix.org and trying to improve Synapse stability generally.

### Dendrite / gomatrixserverlib

Dendrite is a next-generation homeserver written in Go

[Neil Alexander](https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org) said:

> Dendrite is nearing beta! Today we will be cutting a candidate 0.1.0rc1 version after a week of hunting and fixing bugs. We are on track to release version 0.1.0 next week, at which point we will be inviting people to try installing and using Dendrite!
>
> Changes this week include:
>
> * Initial sync is fixed after a bug caused us to fall back on incremental sync
>
> * The `Content-Type` HTTP header is now handled properly when MIME-formatted
> * Internal API calls over HTTP in polylith mode now use their own HTTP client with higher timeouts
>
> * Dendrite now tries harder to find missing auth events, using fetcher workers
> * Dendrite no longer falls back on `/state` unnecessarily, which was the cause of a major memory leak and high CPU usage
>
> * Federation HTTP calls now include the `User-Agent` header
> * The event `depth` field is now ignored in the federation API
>
> * We now report the password change capability properly (thanks [bn4t](https://github.com/bn4t)!)
> * Registration flows now include the `completed` field after a failure (thanks [Lesterpig](https://github.com/Lesterpig)!)
>
> * A bug in the previous event updater in the roomserver has been fixed
> * A bug where we didn't check our own old verify keys when verifying event signatures is fixed
>
> * A bug where we didn't handle event ID domains being different to the event origin in earlier room versions has been fixed
> * TLS fingerprints have been removed
>
> Spec compliance is unchanged:
>
> * Client-Server APIs: 56%, same as last week
>
> * Server-Server APIs: 77%, same as last week
>
> Recently, we updated some of our documentation and created a whole new set of [easy first issues](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) and [medium to hard issues](https://github.com/matrix-org/dendrite/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahelp-wanted) for contributors.
>
> If contributing to Dendrite sounds like something you would be interested in, please take a look at these issues and join us in [#dendrite-dev:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite-dev:matrix.org)! There's also [#dendrite:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite:matrix.org) for general Dendrite chat and updates and [#dendrite-alerts:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#dendrite-alerts:matrix.org) for release notifications and important alerts.

### Conduit

Conduit is a Matrix homeserver written in Rust <https://conduit.rs>

[timo](https://matrix.to/#/@timo:koesters.xyz) reported:

> * Fix bug leading to many requests at the same time due to error in waiting code
>
> * Implement /query/profile over federation
> * Start work on /invite over federation
>
> Thanks to everyone who supports me on [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/timokoesters) or Bitcoin!

### The Construct

[Jason](https://matrix.to/#/@jason:zemos.net) reported:

> This week in Matrix Construct supports aarch64 (ARMv8) architectures. The experience has been phenomenal, with performance exceeding all expectations. Last week I wrote about all new vector code inside Construct using SSE through AVX-512 hardware acceleration in servers; that same code is now accelerated by SVE (Scalable Vector Extensions) on ARM architectures when you compile with clang.
>
> This result is important: ARM virtual machines are offered at a significantly lower price compared to x86 from the same vendor. The systems are cheaper, require less power, but generally perform worse. The trick is to optimize the software for the weaker hardware. The benefit allows, for example, Matrix server hosts running Construct to make th eir profit margin from the lower TCO, getting more out of every computing cycle.
>
> Construct is available at <https://github.com/matrix-construct/construct> and don't forget to idle and idle [#construct:zemos.net](https://matrix.to/#/#construct:zemos.net).

## Synapse Deployment 📥️

### YunoHost

[Pierre](https://matrix.to/#/@pierre:mamieserv.fr) announced:

> [YunoHost](https://yunohost.org) is an operating system aiming for the simplest administration of a server, and therefore democratize self-hosting.
>
> [Synapse](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/synapse_ynh/tree/master) integration had been updated to 1.19.3 (1.20.1 available in branch `testing`)
>
> [Element Web](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/element_ynh/tree/master) integration had been updated to 1.7.7 (1.7.8 available in branch `testing`)

## Dept of Bridges 🌉

### mautrix-signal

[Tulir](https://matrix.to/#/@tulir:maunium.net) said:

> I made a Signal bridge using [signald](https://gitlab.com/thefinn93/signald).
>
> Currently it supports bridging messages, reactions and signal read receipts. End-to-bridge encryption also exists (mautrix-python does all the work there). The bridge can be linked as a secondary device and possibly even registered as the main device, but I didn't actually test registering yet. Setup instructions are currently somewhat non-existent, but it's mostly the same as my other bridges plus signald as a separate daemon.
>
> The repo is <https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-signal> and the room is [#signal:maunium.net](https://matrix.to/#/#signal:maunium.net)

He then popped up again a few days later to say:

> After the initial announcement earlier this week, I implemented a few of the missing features like media bridging, and even added setup instructions.

The speed at which Tulir writes bridges scares me sometimes.

### mx-puppet-discord

[mx-puppet-discord](https://github.com/matrix-discord/mx-puppet-discord) is a (double)puppeting and relay bridge for discord, based on mx-puppet-bridge

[sorunome](https://matrix.to/#/@sorunome:sorunome.de) said:

> mx-puppet-discord got updated to the newest discord.js version, meaning you have to update if you want to continue to operate it, due to discord having changed their gateway url!
>
> mx-puppet-discord now also supports the intent stuff, so be sure to update by 7th oct

**If you run mx-puppet-discord (like I do), make sure to update by October 7th or it will stop working!**

### Bridges do Hackertoberfest

[Half-Shot](https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk) reported:

> Hey folks, I wanted to give another shoutout to say that we are still accepting PRs as part of [hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). Contributing 4 PRs will get you a T-Shirt (sadly not a Matrix one). Obviously, please ensure your PRs are meaningful (no copyright adjustments, typo fixes).
>
> You can work on any issue, but we've highlighted some issues that would be perfect for newcomers over at <https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ahacktoberfest> and <https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ahacktoberfest>

[Cadair](https://matrix.to/#/@cadair:cadair.com) reported:

If you are interested in fixing a little annoyance with the slack bridge or just fancy writing some typescript see the [good first issue](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) label on the repo.

### matrix-appservice-slack 1.6.0 rocks the block

[Half-Shot](https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk) reported:

> The matrix.org team are delighted to bring you the latest in Slack bridging technology. Do not let the
>
> minor version bump fool you, this release is packed with the good stuff. The headline feature is that
> our phase 1 encryption feature has landed and is free for users to experiment with. Head over to the
>
> [docs](https://matrix-appservice-slack.readthedocs.io/en/stable/bridge-encryption/) to see how to
> set this up.
>
> There have been other notable changes, such as:
>
> * New configuration options to allow or deny some channels from being bridged.
>
> * Support removing *reactions* from Slack and Matrix messages.
> * Add onboarding message for new users when puppeting is enabled, to encourage them to puppet.
>
> * Improved feature documentation
>
> (and many many bugfixes)
>
> You can read the release information over at <https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack/releases>

>
> Aside from that we continue to improve on widget support for resizable widgets, modal widgets and generally making widgets better.
>
> We are also continuing to work on instrumenting the app, improving mobile support for matrix.to and making jitsi calling more reliable.

### Element Android

[benoit](https://matrix.to/#/@benoit.marty:matrix.org) told us:

> Element Android: Version 1.0.8 is now available on the stores, it fixes issues with verification and PIN code among other issues (see <https://github.com/vector-im/element-android/releases/tag/v1.0.8> for more details). Now we are working on improving performance when sending messages to rooms, and also improving global UX, especially of the home (rooms list). Search messages (in clear rooms for the moment) is coming soon, and it will be also possible to filter the room members list.
>
> We will also spend some time on the new Android SDK, <https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-android-sdk2>, which is for the moment a quick extract of what we have in Element Android. We have to take care of it as a real product now: document it properly, set up CI, export Javadoc, develop a sample app, etc.

### Element for Nextcloud

[Gary Kim](https://matrix.to/#/@gary:garykim.dev) reported:

> [Element for Nextcloud](https://github.com/gary-kim/riotchat) v0.6.11 has been released this week. The new version comes with various bug fixes, dependency upgrades, and an upgrade to Element Web v1.7.8. The version is also compatible with Nextcloud 20 which is being released soon.

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰

### Ruma

[iinuwa](https://matrix.to/#/@iinuwa:matrix.org) told us:

> Over the past couple of weeks, we've received PRs for all of the remaining federation endpoints, and all but one have already been merged!
>
> Now that the end is in sight, we're turning our focus elsewhere. We're working on cleaning up and fixing a few bugs in our event signing code and soon will create tracking issues for filling out the Identity Service API.

## Dept of Services 🚀

### t2bot.io

[TravisR](https://github.com/turt2live) reported:

> t2bot.io has crossed 1M monthly active users
>
> All of these users are Telegram/Discord users that have been brought into Matrix over the last 30 days. This doesn't appear to be a temporary spike either: over the last 8 weeks t2bot.io has been hovering at 900-950 thousand monthly active users, up from 600-700 thousand. Record-setting traffic levels have also been achieved, with matrix.org being able to keep up for the first time in a long while.
>
> Overall it's a good sign to see so many communities making the jump to Matrix and sticking around ❤️

## Dept of Bots 🤖

### zabbix-matrix

[progserega](https://matrix.to/#/@progserega:rsprim.ru) told us:

> I added zabbix-bot to my zabbix-matrix repo, which can get information about current problems from zabbix-server and send it to matrix user. <https://github.com/progserega/matrix_zabbix>
>
> In our company we use it for get current situation and <https://github.com/progserega/im_sender_service> for sending events from zabbix.

I've found that having your systems reporting in a room while you chat around
it can be really productive. Props to supporting yet another monitoring platform!

## Dept of Interesting Projects 🛰️

### Jitsi E2EE Calls using Olm

While 1-1 calls benefit from end-to-end encryption due to WebRTC, Jitsi group calls have always only benefitted from transport encryption.

A while ago [Jitsi announced](https://jitsi.org/blog/e2ee/) that they were adding E2EE to Jitsi. But did you know that it's using Matrix's Olm encryption under the hood? It's currently available as an experimental feature on [https://meet.jit.si](https://meet.jit.si)!

## Final Thoughts 💭

### XKCD 2365

[Alexandre Franke](https://matrix.to/#/@afranke:matrix.org) told us:

> XKCD made [another strip about messaging systems](https://xkcd.com/2365/) and I’m outraged to see that Matrix has been left out of it.

Not to worry though, we've fixed it up!
