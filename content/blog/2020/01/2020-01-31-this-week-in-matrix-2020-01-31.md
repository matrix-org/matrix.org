## Dept of Servers üè¢

### Synapse

[Neil](https://matrix.to/#/@neilj:matrix.org) offered:

> This week we‚Äôve been continuing our E2EE UX bug hunt, getting Sydent ready for python 3, working on alias rules (MSC2260, 2261) and fixing some bugs in our ACME support.
>
> Next week, we‚Äôll ship the new improved Sydent, keep going with alias rules and dust off our  master process sharding plans.

### Synapse Deployment

Many projects updated:

[Ananace](https://matrix.to/#/@ace:kittenface.studio) announced:

> Just pushed updated 1.9.1 tags for the [K8s-optimized Synapse images](https://github.com/ananace/matrix-synapse), including support - and example config - for running with `securityContext` features enabled. With a separate media repo, it's now fully possible to run these images without root, and in completely read-only environment.

[Mathijs](https://matrix.to/#/@mathijs:matrix.vgorcum.com) announced:

> The synapse 1.9.1 release images are available on avhost/docker-matrix:v1.9.1 and mvgorcum/docker-matrix:v1.9.1 The latter image also contains simple-antispam

and then

> A docker image for synapse 1.10.0rc1 is available on [mvgorcum/docker-matrix:v1.10.0rc1](https://hub.docker.com/r/mvgorcum/docker-matrix)

### ma1sd 2.3.0 released

## Dept of Bridges üåâ

### mx-puppet-bridge

[sorunome](https://matrix.to/#/@sorunome:sorunome.de) offered:

> [mx-puppet-bridge](https://github.com/Sorunome/mx-puppet-bridge) got some updates!
>
> * way more tests (still not good enough test coverage, though!)
> * enhanced reaction support (reaction deletions/redactions are now properly bridged from and to matrix)
> * presence status now sets `im.vector.user_status` event to be in line with riots status labs feature (why doesn't riot just use the spec on presence status here?!)
> * add a message deduplicator class that protocol implementations with echo back can easily implement
> * fix various small bugs
>
> As always, if you have any questions check out the [support channel](https://matrix.to/#/#mx-puppet-bridge:sorunome.de) and please consider to [donate](https://liberapay.com/Sorunome/donate)! (Thanks sooooo much to everyone who donated so far!) ü¶ä
>
> #### matrix-slack-parser
>
> [matrix-slack-parser](https://github.com/Sorunome/matrix-slack-parser/) is, similar to matrix-discord-parser, a parser for slack->matrix and matrix->slack messages. It has been created over this week and does *proper* parsing (meaning HTML parsing and slack blocks, etc.). [mx-puppet-slack](https://github.com/Sorunome/mx-puppet-slack) already implements this, which leaves matrix-appservice-slack to follow suit! (cadair expressed interest, so looking forward to that!)

## Dept of Clients üì±

### Nheko

[@deepbluev7:neko.dev](https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev) offered:

>
> Nheko has added support kicking, inviting and banning/unbanning via the commands `/kick`, `/invite`, `/ban` and `/unban` with an optional reason specified after the userid. Kick and Ban buttons were also enabled for the userprofile. Furthermore some shortcuts for switching rooms (Ctrl+Up/Down) and paginating the timeline (PgUp/PgDown) were added. The shortcuts may change in the future though, so if those don't work for you, please give us feedback in [#nheko-reborn:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#nheko-reborn:matrix.org) or via the [issue](https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko/issues/38)!

### RiotX cross-signing implementation

[benoit](https://matrix.to/#/@benoit.marty:matrix.org) said:

> RiotX: the team is mainly working on cross-signing implementation and device verification with QR code. It's nearly there <https://twitter.com/matrixdotorg/status/1223205391531683845> !

### FluffyChat Flutter is getting a Dark Mode

[MTRNord](https://matrix.to/#/@MTRNord:matrix.ffslfl.net) said:

## Dept of Bots ü§ñ

### New Project: Pluggable Chatbot (PCB) written in Go

[@sava:chat.zorbiro.com](https://matrix.to/#/@sava:chat.zorbiro.com) announced:

> I started a new Pluggable Chatbot (PCB) written in Go. Still early development, but working hard on it. Bot is pluggable, meaning more functionality can be easily added to it. Check it out at  <https://github.com/srados/pcb>.  
> Currently there are two examples available: echo and uppercase.

## Dept of Ping üèì

Here we reveal, rank, and applaud the homeservers with the lowest ping, as measured by [pingbot](https://github.com/maubot/echo), a [maubot](https://github.com/maubot/maubot) that you can host on your own server. Join [#ping:maunium.net](https://matrix.to/#/#ping:maunium.net) to experience the fun live, and to find out how to add YOUR server to the game.

## Final Thoughts üí≠

[Half-Shot](https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk) offered:

> I know it's a bit naughty to post rooms in here, but for developers looking to play around with Vue.js (with matrix), we've created a support room over at [#vue:half-shot.uk](https://matrix.to/#/#vue:half-shot.uk)

## That's all I know üèÅ

See you next week, and be sure to stop by [#twim:matrix.org] with your updates!
