## Dept of *Status of Matrix* 🌡

### Google Summer of Code 2020

Sometimes it seems like existence is a constant loop. Cycles within cycles are replayed, with only minor differences to help us discern the current and the foregoing.  
How can we endure it?

It's not all bad though! Google have announced the return of the **Summer of Code** programme, and have [updated their website with the current year (2020)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) and latest information.

Matrix will be applying to be a Mentoring Organisation, as we have for several years now. This year, we'd like to open the umbrella a little. If you think your (Matrix-related) project could help mentor a student, and that you could offer a meaningful project to that student, please contact me directly. For reference, there were *four* students under the Matrix heading last year, of which one was assigned to work with Kitsune on encryption support in libQuotient.

### FOSDEM 2020

Will you be at FOSDEM this year? Matrix will be very well represented, so please come and see us at our stand, plus attend *all* of the three talks we'll be conducting. Many more details to follow!

## Dept of Services 🚀

## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Dendrite / P2P

[Neil Alexander](https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org) reported:

> I've spent some time this week experimenting with integrating libp2p into dendrite and gomatrixserverlib to understand if we can get link-local homeserver discovery working along with direct or indirect federation. It's still early at the moment but I have had success with early federation requests working over libp2p—hopefully I'll have something interesting to show soon!

### Synapse

[Neil](https://matrix.to/#/@neilj:matrix.org) reported:

> This week we’ve been continuing to work on migrating sydent to py3, improving admin tooling and working on fixing e2ee bugs. We’re also looking to make changes to allow admins the power to remove room aliases (MSCs 2260 2261).

## Dept of *Built on Matrix* 🏗

### Matrix Presents 📽️

[Half-Shot](https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk) told us:

> What is it? Slideshows in Matrix, basically using the matrix room / event primitives to construct presentable federated slide shows.
>
> What's new this week you ask? Well, it breaks less. It also does other neat things.
>
> * Supports guests for viewing presentations, including the ability to specify a guest HS via the URL.
> * Supports code highlighting in the presentation.
> * Lots of CSS fixes to make slides line up properly.
> * A fullscreen mode, which is actually unobstructive and quite handy.
> * Presenter mode, which allows you to switch between following the presenters view of the room, and being able to view at your own leisure.
> * Room joins now actually work, so you can be linked to a slide and expect to be able to view it.
>

## Dept of Clients 📱

### Nheko replies rendering

[@deepbluev7:neko.dev](https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev) said:

> I added pretty rendering of replies to [nheko](https://github.com/Nheko-Reborn/nheko). It uses the same rendering as for normal messages, so you will see an image being replied to and you can even play a replied to video. You can also click on the reply to navigate to that part of the history.

### RiotX: Release v0.13.0

[benoit](https://matrix.to/#/@benoit.marty:matrix.org) said:

It contains typing notification feature, and new screens for Room profile and room members list, and new screen for Room Member profile. Those new screens are still missing a lots of features, that will be implemented in the next weeks. For F-Droid version, it contains a fix on the broken background sync. We are also making big progress on cross-signing implementation, and we have started to write integration tests on the SDK.

[@bubu:bubu1.eu](https://matrix.to/#/@bubu:bubu1.eu) told us:

> RiotX is now available via the f-droid.org repository here: <https://f-droid.org/packages/im.vector.riotx/>

>
> * Update network library ktor to latest release 1.3.0

>
> [Continuum](https://github.com/koma-im/continuum-desktop) desktop client based on Koma:
>
> * Fix empty room directory list by always using the authenticated API `POST /_matrix/client/r0/publicRooms`

## Dept of Ops 🛠

### matrix-docker-ansible-deploy updates

[Slavi](https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:devture.com) told us:

> [matrix-docker-ansible-deploy](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy) can now easily configure automatic Double Puppeting for all of its Mautrix bridges (Facebook, Hangouts, Whatsapp, Telegram). This is possible due to those bridges' integration with [matrix-synapse-shared-secret-auth](https://github.com/devture/matrix-synapse-shared-secret-auth) - yet another component that the playbook can install. Our documentation page for each bridge provides relevant information on how to get it enabled.

Also:

> [matrix-docker-ansible-deploy](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy) can now install and configure [matrix-appservice-webhooks](https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-appservice-webhooks), thanks to a contribution from [Björn Marten](https://github.com/tripleawwy) from [netresearch](https://www.netresearch.de/). Our documentation page about [Appservice Webhooks](https://github.com/spantaleev/matrix-docker-ansible-deploy/blob/48402141935591130f06219f0c6c53e003f0633d/docs/configuring-playbook-bridge-appservice-webhooks.md) tells you how to get started.

### auto-update Riot-Web script

[@murz:ru-matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/@murz:ru-matrix.org) said:

> I have created simple Bash script for auto-update Riot-Web to latest version. Because <https://github.com/vector-im/riot-web> now have no public Wiki, I publish it as Gist here: <https://gist.github.com/MurzNN/ee64f98ab2e71b886c41d55594e5dd9e>

### ruby-grafana-matrix ingress updates

[Ananace](https://matrix.to/#/@ace:kittenface.studio) said:

> My [Grafana notification ingress](https://github.com/ananace/ruby-grafana-matrix) gem received the missing piece of functionality for configuring it for posting both `m.text` as well as the original `m.notice` messages (as well as defaulting to `m.text` now as the more common expectation) - for those that want the messages to also provide Matrix notifications instead of just acting as an added history/flow.
> This can also be configured per-rule, so that you are able to have multiple notification ingresses configured with different message types.
>
> It's always so lovely when people - other than myself - use my projects, especially when providing feedback on them. So many simple-to-implement features that get forgotten just because they weren't part of the original MVP.

## Dept of Bots 🤖

### TWIM bot updated for opsdroid 0.17
