## Dept of Servers 🏢

### Dendrite / P2P

[Neil Alexander](https://matrix.to/#/@neilalexander:matrix.org) announced:

> A fairly big PR was merged into Dendrite yesterday (and some more fixes today) which gets `/sync` working better and adds the `/messages` endpoint, so it's now actually possible to paginate around in channels and to see room history. This massively improves the user experience when logging into a Dendrite homeserver.
>
> In addition, another small PR was merged to fix Riot user login in the normal login workflow (not registration) and the public rooms API has been wired up for roomserver events.
>
> A couple of changes have also been merged into `gomatrixserverlib`, mostly fixing the creation of `/backfill` requests and allowing the use of custom `http.Transport`s for federation traffic.
>
> P2P work is continuing - stay tuned!

### Synapse 1.9.0

[Neil](https://matrix.to/#/@neilj:matrix.org) said:

> This week we shipped [1.9.0](https://matrix.org/blog/2020/01/23/synapse-1-9-0-released/) which contained new admin API endpoints as well as bug fixes for existing ones. Aside from that, we’ve been continuing on our E2EE UX bug hunt and python3ing sydent.
>
> Next week, we’ll keep going on the e2ee ux bug hunt and sydent work. As well as dusting off MSCs [2260](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2260) [2261](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/2261) to improve room aliases management.

#### Deploying Synapse

Several packaging projects have been updated to deploy the new version:

* [avhost/docker-matrix](https://hub.docker.com/r/avhost/docker-matrix) and [mvgorcum/docker-matrix](https://hub.docker.com/r/mvgorcum/docker-matrix) from [Mathijs](https://matrix.to/#/@mathijs:matrix.vgorcum.com)
* [Kubernetes](https://github.com/ananace/matrix-synapse) from [Ananace](https://matrix.to/#/@ace:kittenface.studio)

## Dept of Bridges 🌉

### matrix-appservice-IRC hits 0.14.1

[Half-Shot](https://matrix.to/#/@Half-Shot:half-shot.uk) said:

>
> Hello wannabe IRC and Matrix users! Today the bridge team bring you the 0.14.X series of the irc bridge. This is the mammoth release featuring all the Typescript changes and postgres stuff. The Postgres changes aren't as essential as they are for Synapse, but useful if you run a ~20k Freenode bridge.
>
> The highlights are:
>
> * Typescript is now used everywhere across the project, bringing a range of refactors.
> * Postgresql support has landed, while still retaining NeDB support for the present.
> * Storing your password will now cause a seamless reconnect to the IRC network, allowing you to set a password without having to bother NickServ.
> * Sentry.io support has landed, to trace errors in the bridge.
> * Added a `reapUsers` API endpoint, which allows the bridge to automatically prune users who have not interacted with the bridge for a long time.
>
> Some of these features are still more experimental than others, so the next release hopes to clean up a lot of the outstanding bugs. That's all from us for now :)

### mx-puppet-bridge

[sorunome](https://matrix.to/#/@sorunome:sorunome.de) said:

> A lot happened on the [mx-puppet-bridge](https://github.com/Sorunome/mx-puppet-bridge) front! Mostly documentation and code cleanup to make future development easier.
>
> * Introduce better documentation and a sample config
> * Introduce a demonstration protocol implementation, [mx-puppet-echo](https://github.com/Sorunome/mx-puppet-echo), meant to help those out who want to write their own protocol implementation
> * Eliminate triple-usage of room/channel/chan, it's just called "room" everywhere now
> * Split matrix event handling and remote event handling into their own files/classes
> * Eliminate all usage of the `any` keyword, with the help of matrix-bot-sdk's event models
> * Start writing tests to, well, auto-test the library
> * Various small bugfixes
>
> As always, feel free to drop by the [support room](https://matrix.to/#/[#mx-puppet-bridge:sorunome.de](https://matrix.to/#/#mx-puppet-bridge:sorunome.de)) and please consider [to donate](https://liberapay.com/Sorunome/donate)!

### matrix-discord-parser

[sorunome](https://matrix.to/#/@sorunome:sorunome.de) also added:

> [matrix-discord-parser](https://github.com/matrix-discord/matrix-discord-parser) is the joint matrix->discord and discord->matrix parser that both [mx-puppet-discord](https://github.com/matrix-discord/mx-puppet-discord) and [matrix-appservice-discord](https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord) use. For sending messages matrix->discord optional auto-detection of code language for code blocks using highlight.js has been implemented.

### koma and Continuum, Kotlin Matrix projects

[yuforia](https://matrix.to/#/@uforia:matrix.org) said:

> [koma](https://github.com/koma-im/koma-library), Kotlin library for building clients:
>
> * Responses of the `sync` API can be received continuously using `Flow` (async lazy sequence) now. Compared to previous method which used `Channel`, `Flow` can be transformed and combined in a much more flexible way, and `Flow` stops when it's no longer being consumed, so no coroutine will be left running accidentally.
>
> [Continuum](https://github.com/koma-im/continuum-desktop) desktop client based on Koma:
>
> * Improve startup speed a bit more (Render more UI widgets without waiting for IO operations to finish).

### FluffyChat-Flutter is now available as a web app

[MTRNord](https://matrix.to/#/@MTRNord:matrix.ffslfl.net) reported:

> Check it out at: <https://christianpauly.gitlab.io/fluffychat-flutter/>
>
> It includes everything that the Android App does except for currently notifications and file sharing.

### Riot iOS

[Manu](https://matrix.to/#/@Manu:matrix.org) told us:

>
> This week, in the cross-signing side, we updated e2e decoration, replacing padlocks with shields. We started working on the new device list in the room member screen.

### RiotX, rainbows and other new features

[benoit](https://matrix.to/#/@benoit.marty:matrix.org) said:

> RiotX: We are making progress on cross-signing and verification by QRCode. Also we are working to improve the network detection and paused sync thread issue. But the most important is: "/rainbow" command will be available soon 🌈 !

### Riot Web

[TravisR](https://github.com/turt2live) told us:

> We've done a lot this week, and probably even more next week:
>
> * Continuing on the cross-signing front with support for QR code verification, verification in the right panel, a bunch of shields to indicate trust, some bootstrapping in the secret store, and more!
> * A release candidate for 1.5.8-rc.2 (please give this a test on riot.im/staging)
> * An all-new invite dialog for creating DMs and bringing people into rooms.
