### Matrix Workation, Thailand Edition 🇹🇭

> There’s something a little wild going on in Thailand right now.
> 
> ![A group of people in summer outfits lounging on a sofa, enjoying the sunset. One is participating in a meeting from a hammock in the background.](/blog/img/2026-02-13-workation.avif)
> 
> A group of Matrix enthusiasts traveled straight from **FOSDEM** to **Koh Phangan**, a beautiful island in the Gulf of Thailand, to kick off another Matrix workation. After running a similar setup in 2025 (and having a great time), we decided to do it again.
> This time, we rented a separate house right on the beach - just next door to _La Casa_, a local remote & digital coworking space in Ban Tai. Mornings are spent together, then everyone dives into their own projects. Once a day, preferably at sunset we sync up, and in the evenings we hack, explore, or head out on small excursions together.
> 
> #### Matrix Pop Up MeetUp Koh Phangan
> 
> We’re also connecting with the local community and advocating for Matrix. As part of that, we’re hosting a **Matrix Meetup Koh Phangan** at our beach house on the next two Wednesdays, starting at **6pm**.
> 
> If you’re interested in future Matrix workations or want to stay in the loop, feel free to join our Matrix communication rooms we’re always happy to welcome fellow travellers, hackers, and community builders.

## Dept of Working Groups 💪

### Come and join the Matrix Governing Board Governance Committee Working Group!

[Neil](https://matrix.to/#/@neilj:matrix.org) reports

> Some of you may know that the [Matrix Governing Board](@/foundation/governing-board/index.md ) is made up of committees made up of GB members, each committee then has various working groups to actually get things done formed from members of the wider community alongside a GB member who sponsors the committee. 
> 
> I want call out the formation of a new working group for the Governance Committee. The committee’s charter lives [here](@/foundation/working-groups/governance.md), but in short the role of the committee is to figure out how the Foundation should be structured and operate. So this might include topics such as improving transparency, improving communications internally, making it clear who is responsible for the various Foundation code repositories etc. 
> 
> If you have thoughts on topics that the committee should be sponsoring and want to get involved, you can join the working group room [#governance-wg:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#governance-wg:matrix.org).

### Events WG Wrap-Up

[HarHarLinks](https://matrix.to/#/@kim:sosnowkadub.de) says

> Hi all! This is a very irregular report of what we have been up to over in the [Events Working Group](@/foundation/working-groups/events.md).
> 
> Maybe you've heard of it, but we recently organised the presentation of Matrix at FOSDEM. Part of that was a hackathon at the local hacker space, which superseded the previous concept of a BarCamp. Further innovation involved the creation of a booth setup, which allows us to just grab a backpack, unload it at a conference, and have a working and offline-capable live demo setup with multiple clients. We rely heavily on volunteers form the community offering their time to run conferences. With the experience from The Matrix Conference 2025, we used FOSDEM as testing grounds for our new shift management system. The feedback and experience was very valuable, and we think it worked really well, an overwhelming amount of shifts was taken already weeks before the event! We look forward to making some tweaks and deploying it again soon for The Matrix Conference 2026!
> 
> You can read the full [FOSDEM Wrap Up](@/blog/2026/02/2026-02-06-fosdem-wrap-up.md) over in the blog. If you have any feedback, comments, or suggestions, please share them with us in our room or by email to <events-wg@foundation.matrix.org>.
> 
> In terms of (internal) tooling, we also finally have switched to a proper issue tracker, which is a lot comfortabler to use. Thanks, Foundation! ❤️
> 
> Speaking of The Matrix Conference, we also took the FOSDEM hackathon as an opportunity to publish the [Call for Proposals for 2026](https://conference.matrix.org/)! The Conference will take place in Malmö, Sweden, in October 2026. We are now working on finalising the venue and exact date, and you bet are we eager to tell you more very soon! We are full stream ahead and a lot of new exciting ideas are cooking...
> 
> Meanwhile, Stammtische (local meetups) are popping up all over ~~Germany~~ the World (see above)! The community is maintaining a list over [on their website](https://matrix-community.events/more.html), go find your local one - or Pull Request your own to add it!

### policyserv

[TravisR](https://matrix.to/#/@travis:t2l.io) says

> [v1.2.0](https://github.com/matrix-org/policyserv/releases/tag/v1.2.0) of policyserv, the Foundation's [MSC4284](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4284) policy server implementation, is here! Newly added features include a link filter, initial support for "server-centric" communities, and other filter improvements. 
> 
> We're working on actually using the new text-checking APIs we added for server-centric communities, but the feature does exist to start running text like search queries, newly registered usernames, etc through policyserv. Watch this space for updates on how we progress with Search Redirection and other planned uses of the API. 
> 
> Let us know if there's any bugs in the release at [#policyserv:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#policyserv:matrix.org) 🙂 
> 
> ✨️ If you'd like to give policyserv a try before deploying your own, [apply to use our instance](https://github.com/matrix-org/policyserv-setup-bot?tab=readme-ov-file#usage)! Policy servers are proactive tooling that aim to prevent spammy messages from ever reaching your community members, and work well alongside your existing moderation bot setup.

### continuwuity ([website](https://continuwuity.org/))

Continuwuity is a community-driven Matrix homeserver in Rust.

[nex (it/she) 🏳️‍⚧️](https://matrix.to/#/@nex:nexy7574.co.uk) says

> **Continuwuity 0.5.4**
> 
> It feels like just last week I had the envs.net hedgedoc page open, writing another TWIM post for a continuwuity release. Yet here we are again. Time flies when you're fixing bugs, or however the saying goes.
> 
> This week we've got a smaller bugfix release that also has some security fixes and new features in it. Quite all rounded! Here's a couple things that changed since 0.5.3:
> 
> - 🔐 **Fixed a vulnerability** that could allow evil remote servers to trick yours into sending unexpected events while joining or knocking on a remote room.
> - 🔎 Fixed a bug that caused the server to incorrectly fall back to unauthenticated media when fetching remote authenticated media failed.
> - 📤 Reduced the likelihood of being state reset back into a room you previously left by refusing to process events belonging to said disconnected rooms.
> - 🔇 Logs will no longer be spammed by "type not supported" when a client is trying to register and is asking about out-of-band completion.
> - 📥 The documentation for installing on Fedora no longer lies to you.
> 
> As always, the full changelog is available on our forgejo, along with release binaries, and all the information you could ever need about a release. See 0.5.4's release here: <https://forgejo.ellis.link/continuwuation/continuwuity/releases/tag/v0.5.4>.
> If you enjoy the work we're doing for the Matrix ecosystem, please consider giving us a star on [GitHub](https://github.com/continuwuity/continuwuity) - it massively helps us with visibility!
> 
> [0.6.0](https://forgejo.ellis.link/continuwuation/continuwuity/milestone/36) is already in the oven, so don't forget to stay tuned for that one. You can get more active updates from us by joining [#continuwuity:continuwuity.org](https://matrix.to/#/#continuwuity:continuwuity.org), or by joining our active offtopic room at [#offtopic:continuwuity.org](https://matrix.to/#/#offtopic:continuwuity.org). We've also got a host of other rooms (including new ones) in our space: [#space:continuwuity.org](https://matrix.to/#/#space:continuwuity.org). Come say hi!

>   *(Status: in progress — early stages)*
> 
> - **CI tools — experimental transition**  
>   We’re exploring moving from **Fastlane** to **custom Swift build scripts**.  
>   *(Status: experimental / prototype — Fastlane still active)*
>

> 
> - 🎉 **Spaces v2** — shipping soon  
> - 🔄 **Swift strict concurrency** — work kicked off  
> - 🧪 **CI transition** — experimental
> 
> *Stay tuned. The Matrix evolves… again.* 🚀
  
### Element X Android ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-android))

Android Matrix messenger application using the Matrix Rust SDK and Jetpack Compose.

[Jorge](https://matrix.to/#/@jorgem:element.io) reports

> Ladies and gentlemen, I'm happy to announce the work on spaces is done! The feature is available in the latest [v26.02.0](https://github.com/element-hq/element-x-android/releases/tag/v26.02.0) release candidate which is now on the open beta channel, and will be officially released next week if everything goes well. We hope you all enjoy it!
> 
> That's all for the exciting news, I'm afraid. The rest of the week we've been focused on fixing some annoying bugs, trying to measure sync performance to check how we can improve it, improving how fallback notifications work (those 'You have new messages' ones you see from time to time) and other minor adjustments to the UX of the app.

## Dept of Widgets 🧩

[Timo K.](https://matrix.to/#/@toger5:matrix.org) reports

### Expenses Widget

> When you travel with a group, you end up sharing a lot of things: grocery shopping, dinners, scooters, taxis and occasionally lending each other money. Keeping track of who paid what for whom can get messy surprisingly fast.
> 
> Back in 2025, we started experimenting with a **Matrix-based solution** to make this easier.
> 
> The idea is simple: we create a shared room where every participant posts their expenses. Each message follows a lightweight, human-readable syntax. For example:
> 
> ```
> 1000 nice dinner $ @me / @me @myfriend:example.com @myotherfriend:example.com
> ```
> 
> This reads as:
> 
> The event sender paid **1000** (whatever the currency) for a nice dinner. The cost is split equally between the event sender and the listed participants.
> 
> The whole user experience is about having a Splitwise-like feature set without having a separate app. All clients that can send room messages should be able to send expenses.
> 
> From these messages, we can:
> 
> - keep a running balance for everyone in the group
> - calculate settlements at the end of the trip
> - stay transparent without spreadsheets or external apps
> 
> To get an overview, we have developed a widget that can visualize, summarize, and interpret the data.
> 
> ![The widget shows a list of Matrix IDs and their "account balance" and the calculated payments required to settle the balance.](/blog/img/2026-02-13-expense-widget.avif)
> 
> Widgets currently don’t have access to the _full_ room history by default. For short trips with few expenses, there’s a simple workaround: scroll to the beginning of the room before opening the widget, and everything will work as expected.
> 
> For longer trips with extensive room history, we went a step further and created a **pull request for Element Web**: <https://github.com/element-hq/element-web/pull/32430>
> 
> This change allows Element Web to fetch additional events when a widget requests them, giving widgets access to the complete set of messages in a room.
> 
> There are certainly better long-term solutions, but as a stopgap, this approach works well. Alternatively, room history exports can also be imported.
> 
> The widget itself is fully reactive - try it out and watch how it updates instantly when someone posts a new expense to the room (copy this into you element web message composer):
> 
> ```
> /addwidget https://matrix-expenses-widget-nightly.netlify.app/#/?widgetId=$matrix_widget_id&userId=$matrix_user_id&roomId=$matrix_room_id&baseUrl=$org.matrix.msc4039.matrix_base_url&deviceId=$org.matrix.msc3819.matrix_device_id
> ```
> 
> Source code:
> <https://codeberg.org/matrix-community/expenses-matrix-widget>
> 
> And of course, the room isn’t just about numbers: it also includes screenshots, settlement summaries, and the occasional funny GIF or photo - because trips should stay fun, even when tracking expenses.

## Dept of Interesting Projects 🛰️

[Miklós Zsitva](https://matrix.to/#/@nurefexc:nurefexc.com) announces

> Hi everyone!
> I've just released the initial version (v1) of Matrix Status Monitor, a lightweight GNOME Shell extension (45-49) for tracking unread notifications and favorite rooms directly from the top bar.
> 
> - Built with GJS/ESM and Soup 3.0, it features a minimalist 'Status Pill' design and LIFO sorting for active rooms.
> - What's coming next week: > I'm already working on a v2 update that will bring even tighter system integration (Libadwaita-inspired UI) and improved status feedback, including better handling of encrypted room states and real-time sync optimizations.
> - Check out the code and stay tuned for the update: <https://github.com/nurefexc/matrix-status>
