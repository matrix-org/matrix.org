> 
> Structure (high level):
> 
> * Arrival and onboarding day
> * Two main working days (hacking, workshops, focused sessions)
> * One day with outreach, knowledge sharing, and community topics
> * Wrap-up and departure day (including Towel Day traditions at c-base)
> 
> There are no product booths or sales tracks. Participation is open to developers, operators, designers, community organizers, and users interested in actively contributing to Matrix.

## Dept of Servers 🏢
  
### continuwuity ([website](https://continuwuity.org/))

Continuwuity is a community-driven Matrix homeserver in Rust.

[nex (it/she) 🏳️‍⚧️](https://matrix.to/#/@nex:nexy7574.co.uk) says

> ### Continuwuity 0.5.5
> 
> Yeah so Discord did a thing and it's been great for us apparently. In terms of numbers at least, it's certainly highlighted loads of new issues with our software. If only we could do something about that...
> Oh wait, we have! Shouldn't be a surprise by now, most people know how we do things now, but alas, apparently I've got to "notify" people of "new releases" to "improve publicity" and "get people to update their servers". So I'm taking an incredibly short break from the confines of my code editor to tell you what's changed! Aren't you lucky.
> 
> Continuwuity 0.5.5 is another bugfix release that aims to smooth over some of the rough edges encountered by the huge wave of new deployments. We haven't fixed every issue ever known, but there's a fair selection. Here's an excerpt from our [release notes](https://forgejo.ellis.link/continuwuation/continuwuity/releases/tag/v0.5.5) (which you should _really_ read this week, even if you don't usually):
> 
> * 📨 Fixed incoming invites not appearing or appearing in a broken form.
> * ⚡ Deployments using LDAP are allowed to have persistent admins again (the server doesn't forget anymore).
> * 📞 Element Call now works on Element X.
> * 👀 Fixed a bug where the server may accidentally leak an appservice's access token to a remote server in an error message.
> 
> We also added some new things this time! You may enjoy:
> 
> * 🌐 You can now customise the user agent sent when generating server-side URL previews (which may allow you to get around user agent filters).
> * 🤝 The error messages for joining remote rooms have been vastly improved, and the relevant logs are also much more informative.
> * 🖥️ Setting up a new Continuwuity server is now easier than ever. We removed the annoying first-user dance and instead replaced it with a "first-run experience", which allows you to get started with Continuwuity _much_ easier. This also means it's now even harder to run an insecure server, even temporarily.
> 
> But that's all the lure I'm going to dangle here. Like I said, you'll have to read the release notes for the full experience!
> 
> Big things are happening. Be there or be square. You can be square while being there too. Actually you can be any shape you want to be, just be there or I'll cast FOMO on you. And by "there" I mean [#continuwuity:continuwuity.org](https://matrix.to/#/#continuwuity:continuwuity.org). And [#announcements:continuwuity.org](https://matrix.to/#/#announcements:continuwuity.org). Actually, just take a look through [#space:continuwuity.org](https://matrix.to/#/#space:continuwuity.org). There's lots of places to be. You can be square in all of them.

## Homeserver Deployment 📥️
  
### Element Server Suite ([website](https://element.io/server-suite))

Element Server Suite (ESS) is a backend hosting solution for Matrix-based communications that supports self-hosted and fully managed deployments.

[Patrick Maier](https://matrix.to/#/@pmaier:element.io) says

> ### Element’s multi-tenancy solution secures ‘Good’ rating in gematik commissioned pentest
> 
> We're delighted to announce that our Synapse Pro solution for multi-tenancy Matrix hosting [has been deemed 'Good' in a dedicated penetration test commissioned by gematik](https://element.io/blog/elements-multi-tenancy-ti-messenger-solution-secures-good-rating-in-gematik-commissioned-pentest/). The pentest shows we now provide a production-ready solution for TI-Messenger Pro hosting, as well as for other Matrix service providers that want to operate thousands of individual Matrix backends efficiently and economically. Synapse Pro for Small Hosts reduces hardware and personnel costs for hosting whole fleets of small Synapse deployments by up to 90% compared to individual Synapse instances. It comes as part of [ESS Pro](https://element.io/en/server-suite/pro), [ESS Pro for TI-Messenger](https://element.io/en/server-suite/ti-messenger), and also provides a standalone deployment for those who want to use it with their own Matrix stack. As usual, it provides a great out-of-the-box experience and can easily be used with CD tooling (like ArgoCD) for fleet management and automation.
> 
> Learn more about the pentest in our [dedicated blog post](https://element.io/blog/elements-multi-tenancy-ti-messenger-solution-secures-good-rating-in-gematik-commissioned-pentest/) and about Synapse Pro [here](https://element.io/en/server-suite/synapse-pro).

## Dept of Clients 📱
  
### Nheko ([website](https://nheko-reborn.github.io))

Desktop client for Matrix using Qt and C++20.

[Nico](https://matrix.to/#/@deepbluev7:neko.dev) announces

> I finally got around to fixing room version 12 support in Nheko, I hope (with a lot of help from nep). Please try out the nightlies and test if you can now properly be the creator of a v12 room and that editing power levels isn't broken in funky ways. It was quite a significant refactor and we want to make sure nothing broke because of this!
> 
> Apart from that other people have been working on way cooler quality of life changes than me like ensuring the tray icon doesn't gaslight you about window visibility, allowing more options on how the Enter key works or fixing the scroll interaction with combo boxes in the settings.
> 
> I know it has been a bit quite from our side, but we are still here! We are just playing hide and seek or so!
  
### Element X iOS ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios))

> This week the iOS crew shipped a tight, focused sequel — features, tests, and infra tightening the plot.
> 
> #### Features — media hits
>
> - **Playback speed button** + **variable voice-message playback** — fine-grained audio controls for voice messages and playback UI (faster playback, smoother UX).  
>   (PRs: [#5124](https://github.com/element-hq/element-x-ios/pull/5124), [#5121](https://github.com/element-hq/element-x-ios/pull/5121))
> 
> #### Tests & CI — the long, quiet montage
>
> - Large migration of tests to **Swift Testing**: Unit + Compound + UI test workstreams modernized.  
> - **CI**: moving away from Ruby/Fastlane to Swift-based tooling — fewer layers, stronger types.  
>   (PRs: [#5119](https://github.com/element-hq/element-x-ios/pull/5119), [#5110](https://github.com/element-hq/element-x-ios/pull/5110), [#5105](https://github.com/element-hq/element-x-ios/pull/5105), [#5109](https://github.com/element-hq/element-x-ios/pull/5109), [#5117](https://github.com/element-hq/element-x-ios/pull/5117))
> 
> #### Session & privacy — the alliance
>
> - **Session verification** unified with Android; UI tests refreshed.  
> - DM default history visibility set to **`.invited`** — privacy-first default.  
>   (PRs: [#5116](https://github.com/element-hq/element-x-ios/pull/5116), [#5120](https://github.com/element-hq/element-x-ios/pull/5120), [#5114](https://github.com/element-hq/element-x-ios/pull/5114))
> 
> #### Infra & tooling — tightening the strings
>
> - Tracing config updated with size/age limits; Sentry dSYM lane fixed; Gemfile updated for Ruby 4.0; SDK & dependency bumps.  
>   (PRs: [#5108](https://github.com/element-hq/element-x-ios/pull/5108), [#5112](https://github.com/element-hq/element-x-ios/pull/5112), [#5101](https://github.com/element-hq/element-x-ios/pull/5101), [#5081](https://github.com/element-hq/element-x-ios/pull/5081), [#5089](https://github.com/element-hq/element-x-ios/pull/5089))
  
### Element X Android ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-android))

Android Matrix messenger application using the Matrix Rust SDK and Jetpack Compose.

[Jorge](https://matrix.to/#/@jorgem:element.io) says

> This week has been a quiet one in the team, mainly focused on improving the UX of the app and fixing bugs. We've started investigating performance improvements for the data syncs, and the planning for adding live location sharing. 
> 
> We hope there are more exciting news to share next week!

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰

### pygomx ([website](https://codeberg.org/saces/pygomx))

A golang matrix high level client library with c-bindings for python

[saces](https://matrix.to/#/@saces:c-base.org) announces

> I want a library that hides all the matrix 2.0 from me and let me build my business logic in python and do quick&dirty (matrix)helper scripts. I did not found any I wanted to use, so I built my own, but with — no I'm not Bender🤖 — a simple text based c-api and multi client support:
> 
> - project home: <https://codeberg.org/saces/pygomx>
> - matrix room: [#pygomx:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#pygomx:matrix.org)
> 
> pygomx is a monorepos to keep the right versions together and consists of three parts:
> 
> ##### libmxclient - golang matrix client library
>
> - High level client library with a simple c-api: it basically passes (json)strings back and forth.
> - All the Matrix 2.0 magic is hidden in the lib.
> - Should work on *any* platform golang is enable to build for.
> 
> ##### pygomx-module - python binding package
>
> - This package contains only the python bindings module binary
> - Should work on any platform you have a decent python and c-compiler for.
> 
> ##### smal - simple matrix application library
>
> - Matrix library and tools that utilizes the bindings
> - Inspired by [Simple-Matrix-Bot-Lib](https://codeberg.org/imbev/simplematrixbotlib)
> - Example tool: 
> 
> ```python
> import sys
> from _pygomx import lib, ffi
> import click
> import json
> 
> 
> @click.command()
> @click.argument("domain", metavar="string")
> def discoverhs(domain):
>     """Attempts to discover the homeserver from the given string"""
>     mxid = domain.encode(encoding="utf-8")
> 
>     r = lib.cli_discoverhs(mxid)
>     result = ffi.string(r).decode("utf-8")
>     lib.FreeCString(r)
>     if result.startswith("ERR:"):
>         print(result)
>         sys.exit(1)
>     result_dict = json.loads(result)
>     print(result_dict["m.homeserver"]["base_url"])
> ```

> - Minimal bot example:
> 
> ```python
> from smal.bot import SMALBot
> DEFAULT_PREFIX = "!"
> 
> class MinimalBot(SMALBot):
>     def on_sys(self, ntf):
>         print("Got a system notification: ", ntf)
>     def on_event(self, evt):
>         print("Got a matrix event: ", evt)
>     def on_message(self, msg):
>         print("Got a room massage: ", msg)
> 
> def main():
>     # create and initialize the bot
>     bot = MinimalBot(DEFAULT_PREFIX)
>     # start syncing forever (listen for incommmig messages/events)
>     bot.run()
> 
> if __name__ == "__main__":
>     main()
> ```
> 
> ---
> 
> The project is at an early stage, things are still subject to change, but the basics are done and working.  
> Let's see where it evolves.
> 
> Help would be welcome for python packaging, especially for building anywheels.

> That's all for now, see you.
  
### matrix-rust-sdk ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk))

Your all-in-one toolkit for creating Matrix clients with Rust, from simple bots to full-featured apps, with bindings to Swift, Kotlin, WebAssembly, Go and more, sponsored by Element.

[Ivan 🦀](https://matrix.to/#/@mnt_io:matrix.org) announces

> Salut ! It's been a while since our last report. Time flies and we are pretty busy. I'll try to keep it short!
> 
> #### Event Cache
> 
> - [#6190](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/6190) A pretty subtle bug has been fixed where a batch token could have been ditched in rare situations (when the sync only returns events that have been inserted inside the Event Cache via the Send Queue). The impact of this bug was missing events, so, rather important.
> - [#6157](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/6157) An undecrypted event in a `ThreadSummary` could be decrypted later, but the `ThreadSummary` wasn't aware of that: showing a UTD whilst it wasn't. Now it's no longer the case!
> - [#6085](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/6085) The pinned events are now persisted in the storage.
> 
> #### Latest Event
> 
> - [#6171](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/6171) `LatestEventValue::RemoteInvite` is computed once per room, avoiding a bug where receiving some events in an invite room could have refreshed the `LatestEventValue`'s timestamp, thus moving the room to the top of the Room List.
> - [#6143](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/6143) Not all `m.room.member` events are equal. We have restricted when `m.room.member` represents a `LatestEvent` candidate.
> - [#6096](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/6096) An edit of an event was reflected in the `LatestEventValue`, but not an edit of an edit. Well, the approach to handle edit aggregation has been revisited.
> 
> #### Logs
> 
> - [#6162](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/6162) When the logs have accumulated and were too large, they could have been rejected by the rageshake servers. We've replaced `RollingFileAppended` by a custom `SizeAndDateRollingWriter`.
> - [#6140](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/6140) A new tool to help analyse the logs produced by `matrix_sdk_ffi`: `cargo xtask log overview`. It displays the logs in a tree of targets and log levels.
> 
> #### Stores
> 
> - [#6160](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/6160) Not all environments need a cross-process lock, such as Android where an app usually runs in a single process (a contrario of iOS where notifications live in a different process than the main app). To improve performances, we've created `CrossProcessLockConfig` to configure the number of process and to act accordingly.
> - [#6130](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/6130) Creating a notification client from a regular client wasn't correctly separating the data, some were wrongly shared. This has been fixed by moving `BaseClient::room_info_notable_update_sender` into `BaseStateStore`. It breaks a couple of API, but they are simpler now.
> 
> #### Sync
> 
> - [#6148](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/6148) `""`, `null`, or simply unset, this problem with JSON and the Matrix specification seems endless. Fix a deserialisation failure when the `avatar_url` is `null`.
> - [#6136](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/6136) Exclude service members from room names when using Sliding Sync to get notifications.
> - [#6126](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/6126) A user was unaware they've been invited in a room they have previously left. The SDK knew, but the update wasn't broadcasted correctly. This is now fixed!
> 
> #### FFI
> 
> - [#6122](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/6122) The `NotificationItem` now includes the raw JSON of the underlying event.
> - [#6116](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/6116) Do not override the `package_name` and the `cdylib_name` value for Kotlin bindings.
> - [#6112](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/6112) and [#6115](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/6115) UniFFI checksums have been removed.
> - [#6101](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/6101) Add a `dist` profile with optimised binary size. The `matrix-sdk-ffi` library size is now 50-70MB smaller _per architecture_, resulting in very significant file size reduction for universal APKs, which have 4 architectures!
  
### libQuotient ([website](https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient))

A Qt6 library to write cross-platform clients for Matrix

[kitsune](https://matrix.to/#/@kitsune:matrix.org) reports

> ### libQuotient 0.9.6.1
>
> After a couple of hiccups, a new maintenance release of libQuotient is out, mostly with backports of what is already there in `dev` branch (yet unreleased). The release notes are [in the usual place](https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/releases/0.9.6.1). Most importantly, and as the release notes mention, the libQuotient development leads (namely, Tobias Fella and @kitsune:matrix.org) met in person at the [Matrix hackathon before FOSDEM](https://mastodon.matrix.org/@matrix/115988282038385284) and agreed on making 0.10 beta soon after the E2EE backend based on matrix-rust-sdk-crypto [gets merged](https://github.com/quotient-im/libQuotient/pull/820), which is likely to happen in the coming week or two. Gird your loins, surely it's going to be fabulous!

### Matrix Connectivity Tester ([website](https://connectivity-tester.mtrnord.blog))

A web interface to debug and troubleshoot Matrix connectivity issues.

[MTRNord (they/them)](https://matrix.to/#/@mtrnord:mtrnord.blog) reports

> Hi everyone! For a while now I was working on a redesign based on the UK-Gov rebranded design for connectivity tester.
> 
> This release contains also some other features you might be interested in:
> 
> #### Frontend
> 
> - Better accessibility
> - SSR (client side tests for the Client-Server API are still run in the browser)
> - A start in adding documentation on all the things you may be interested in when debugging with the connectivity tester. Be aware that this is a work in progress and they are not fully done yet.
> - The UI now offers guidance of possible ways to fix the encountered problems
> - Statistics page was fully revamped to look be more readable
> - The results page tries to be more focused on what people actually need as a TLDR while still allowing more detailed information to be accessed quickly.
> 
> You can find it at the usual places <https://connectivity-tester.mtrnord.blog> or <https://federationtester.mtrnord.blog>
> 
> #### Backend
> 
> - Fixing the spurious failure emails happening which seemingly are unreproducible
> - Using OAuth 2.0 instead of magic emails for alerts (yes it has a migration path and yes that's optional for now. This will require UI changes first to be usable)
> - Improved API docs at <https://connectivity-tester.mtrnord.blog/api-docs>
> - Improved logging capabilities
> - Improved email layout
> 
> #### Other changes
> 
> As part of the redesign I did set up a Weblate instance at <https://weblate.mtrnord.blog/projects/matrix-connectivity-tester/> which people can use to contribute translations for the UI and soon also the documentation pages. This hopefully will result in a more user friendly UI in the long run.
> 
> #### Where can I find out more?
> 
> The backend can be found at <https://github.com/MTRNord/rust-federation-tester>
> The frontend can be found at <https://github.com/MTRNord/matrix-connection-tester-ui>
> And a mailing list can be found at <https://lists.midnightthoughts.space/mailman3/lists/matrix-connectivity-tester.lists.midnightthoughts.space/> if you prefer to not use GitHub.
> 
> At this time we do not offer a Matrix room due to the efforts it would take to moderate it.
> 
> As usual please open issues if you find issues for the UI or backend or write an email to the mailinglist if you do not like to use GitHub.

### matrix-jukebox

[bgt lover](https://matrix.to/#/@bgtlover:stealthy.club) reports

> Yesterday, I merged the contribution by Onestacked which adds compatibility with element call to our encryption code by adding the key derivation function element call uses because of the livekit JS sdk.
> 
> So, finally, we can have a bot which joins a matrix rtc session, currently an element call, and plays...pink noise? yup, as a proof of concept and we'll have a proper jukebox interface soon, whatever form that might have, but it's still incredible this works at all!

[Slavi [etke.cc]](https://matrix.to/#/@slavi:etke.cc) says

> All this talk of Continuwuity motivates me to also post something.
> 
> Users were asking if [baibot](https://github.com/etkecc/baibot) works on Continuwuity. Apparently, there was an issue with Continuwuity v0.5.4, which got resolved in Continuwuity v0.5.5. It turned out that baibot is working as expected. To test this, we had to add Continuwuity support to our baibot development environment. We even went as far as making Continuwuity the default homeserver implementation for the development environment, as that's a simpler & faster setup.

> _**tl:dr** Try out a new Godot Plugin that makes in-room multiplayer gaming / collaboration via widgets (by using MatrixRTC) easy!_
> 
> **Interested?** Visit the repo at [cyclikal94/godot-matrix-rtc](https://github.com/cyclikal94/godot-matrix-rtc), install via the [Godot Asset Library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/4788) and if you want some help, you can chat about MatrixRTC over in [#webrtc:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#webrtc:matrix.org).
> 
> ---
> 
> This week I finished [`godot-matrix-rtc`](https://github.com/cyclikal94/godot-matrix-rtc), a Godot plugin and sample project that makes it easier to get started using MatrixRTC in games and widgets created using Godot.

> Following the FOSDEM'26 [MatrixRTC x Godot - A Battle Royale](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/UW9GKA-matrixrtc-godot-battle-royale/) talk, I initially started this project as a UI update to [@toger5](https://github.com/toger5)'s [Godot-MatrixRTC-Keyboard-Kart](https://github.com/toger5/Godot-MatrixRTC-Keyboard-Kart) project, aka FloorIt Ipsum.
> 
> The aim was to make it cleanly adapt to different widget sizes and orientations, however this evolved into a separate reusable plugin bringing the Join/Leave UI and Logic into the Godot project.

> #### Details
> 
> The plugin adds a `GodotMatrixRTC` node to Godot which can be used to send/receive data from the RTC session, allowing multiplayer gameplay through a widget added to your room.
> 
> Once enabled, the plugin will set up a specific Export Preset and an `EditorExportPlugin` automatically includes the pre-requisite Element Call SDK `dist` so all you need to do is export your project, then deploy somewhere. No cloning or `yarn build:sdk` required!

### Matrix Status Monitor for GNOME (v5)

[Miklós Zsitva](https://matrix.to/#/@nurefexc:nurefexc.com) announces

> The Matrix Status Monitor for GNOME Shell has reached v5, providing a faster way to navigate your Matrix rooms directly from the system panel.
> 
> What’s new:
>
> - Security at a glance: Integrated E2EE status icons for rooms.
> - Choose your client: Added explicit support for Element and Fractal. The extension uses native URI schemes to switch focus to your preferred app seamlessly.
> - Self-host friendly: Easily configurable for custom homeservers and tokens.
> - Metadata-only: Maintains privacy by only fetching room status and unread counts.
> 
> Source Code: <https://github.com/nurefexc/matrix-status>
> Install: <https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/9328/matrix-status-monitor/>

### MSC Redirector (msc.re)

[evol](https://matrix.to/#/@evol:evolved.systems) says

> If you've been following Matrix for a while, you've probably noticed people mentioning Matrix's spec proposals (MSCs) by number, e.g. MSC4297.
> All MSCs are pull requests in the [official repository](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals). Often, I wanted to check what a MSC was about, but if it wasn't directly linked, I had to go to the repository and look for the MSC in there. I found that to be tedious, so I went and built <https://msc.re>!
> 
> It's very simple: typing a number after the slash (e.g. <https://msc.re/4297>) will redirect you to the right MSC. Typing nothing (<https://msc.re>) will take you to the home page of the repository. That's it!
> 
> The code is tiny and open source, check it out: <https://github.com/evoL/msc-redirect>. Join [#msc-re:evolved.systems](https://matrix.to/#/#msc-re:evolved.systems) if you'd like to chat!
