## Homeserver Deployment 📥️
  
### Element Server Suite ([website](https://element.io/server-suite))

Element Server Suite (ESS) is a backend hosting solution for Matrix-based communications that supports self-hosted and fully managed deployments.

[Ben BZ](https://matrix.to/#/@ben:banzan.uk) reports

> **Element Server Suite 26.1.0 and LTS releases are now available**
> 
> A new year and the first new releases of ESS for the year! ESS Community [26.1.0](https://github.com/element-hq/ess-helm/releases/tag/26.1.0) and ESS Pro [26.1.0](https://docs.element.io/latest/element-server-suite-pro/release-notes/#ess-pro-2610-2026-01-14) have been released, bringing in the latest Element Web, Synapse and Matrix Authentication Service versions. Both also have gained support for making [additional files available](https://github.com/element-hq/ess-helm/pull/957) in the container for each component, enabling use-cases like customising the email templates used by Matrix Authentication Service.
> 
> We'd also like to provide a reminder to anyone running versions of ESS Community or Pro older than 25.12.2 that they should upgrade to a newer version to obtain the fix for the critical security issue that's being tracked as `ELEMENTSEC-2025-1670`.
> 
> ESS Classic 25.04 LTS and 25.10 LTS have also had releases to upgrade Postgres and migrate from `ingress-nginx` to Traefik due to end of support lifetimes for both.

### Element X iOS ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-ios))

A total rewrite of Element iOS using the Matrix Rust SDK underneath and targeting devices running iOS 17+.

[Ștefan](https://matrix.to/#/@stefan.ceriu:matrix.org) reports

> The team has continued making progress on spaces functionality and quality improvements. Highlights from this week:
> 
> **Create Space Flow** - Users can now create spaces directly from the Space Explorer screen. This includes a redesigned avatar button, proper power level overrides for spaces, and disabled knocking regardless of feature flags. Work is underway on the Add Rooms to Space screen to allow managing space contents.
> 
> **QR Code Device Linking** - Added support for linking new devices via QR code in the authentication flow, with comprehensive test coverage and UI refinements to match platform designs. Tests now cover both mobile and desktop device linking scenarios.
> 
> **URL Linkification Fixes** - Fixed two related issues with URL detection: email addresses no longer get incorrectly treated as URLs, and URLs with trailing brackets now preserve their closing parentheses when clicked.
> 
> **Polish & Cleanup** - Improved snapshot tests for the Create Room flow using UIImage for local thumbnail rendering, tidied space-related naming across the codebase for consistency, and updated both SDK and build dependencies including Fastlane.
  
### Element X Android ([website](https://github.com/vector-im/element-x-android))

Android Matrix messenger application using the Matrix Rust SDK and Jetpack Compose.

[Jorge](https://matrix.to/#/@jorgem:element.io) announces

> This is the first TWIM of the year for the Element X Android team! Sorry for the hiatus, we just wanted to give you some _space_ 🥁 _\*ba-dum-tss\*_ 🥁 :
> 
> - Spaces - as the time for officially releasing the feature is approaching lots of work is still happening in this area, including:
>     - Creating spaces.
>     - Removing rooms from spaces.
>     - Modifying users, permissions and roles in spaces.
> - Room list improvements: the room list is using a new loading and sorting algorithm that should make it faster and more reliable.
> - Voice messages now have a speed modifier when being played, so you can listen to them at 0.5x, 1.5x or 2x the default speed.
> - Replying to a notification won't trigger the notification sound anymore - sorry about this!
> - There were some UX and accessibility improvements in several screens, like the session verification or the QR code login ones.
> - We're also working on improving the migration from Element Classic to Element X when the 2 apps are installed in the same device.
> - And of course, there is a long list of bugfixes.
> 
> Last but not least, Element X Android [v26.01.0](https://github.com/element-hq/element-x-android/releases/tag/v26.01.0) has been pre-released and is in open testing. Get it while it's hot and please report any issue you find!

## Dept of SDKs and Frameworks 🧰
  
### matrix-rust-sdk ([website](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk))

Your all-in-one toolkit for creating Matrix clients with Rust, from simple bots to full-featured apps, with bindings to Swift, Kotlin, WebAssembly, Go and more, sponsored by Element.

[Ivan 🦀](https://matrix.to/#/@mnt_io:matrix.org) reports

> Happy New (Gregorian) Year folks! Back at work after a couple of weeks off for the team and most of the contributors. Snow is falling outside, cold is here to last, kids are building igloos, let's see what happens in the Matrix Rust SDK recently. 
> 
> #### Latest Event
> 
> We are polishing the last bits, but the meta issue can be closed. The API is considered stable and fulfill its promises.
> 
> - [#6035](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/6035) The `LatestEventValue` is erased when a room has been emptied. This is useful when a user is ignored: the `LatestEventValue` will automatically be re-computed.
> - [#6016](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/6016) Some errors from the Send Queue are recoverable, and must not mark the `LatestEventValue` as `LocalCannotBeSent`, but must keep being a `LocalIsSending`.
> 
> #### Sliding Sync
> 
> We have cleaned up the Sliding Sync API a bit to remove the sticky parameters feature entirely, making `request.room_subscriptions` non-sticky every time. Also, once a room subscription is sent, it's not necessary to send it again, thus reducing the size of the request payloads.
> 
> - [#6002](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/6002) and [#6009](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/6009) The `sliding_sync::sticky_parameters` has been entirely removed (an artifact from MSC3575).
> - [#6012](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/6012) New methods on `SlidingSync`: `unsubscribe_to_rooms` to unsubscribe to a set of rooms, and `clear_and_subscribe_to_rooms` to reset the subscriptions and subscription to a fresh set of rooms.
> - [#6005](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/6005) Introduce the `PollTimeout` type to control the `timeout` query parameter to `/sync` with more delicacy.
> 
> #### Space
> 
> A lot of work is happening on the Space API, but a single PR has been merged:
> 
> - [#6010](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/6010) Add `CreateRoomParameters::is_space` in the bindings.
> 
> #### SQLite
> 
> Our quest to improve SQLite performance is pursuing:
> 
> - [#6004](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/6004) Add WAL checkpoints when creating DB pools and vacuuming. To quote the author:
> 
>   > We've noticed the WAL files growing larger and larger, not shrinking as expected. This may be due to connections being busy and not allowing the automatic WAL checkpoints to perform this shrinking operation or some other causes, we're still investigating the issue.
>
>   >
>   > In the meantime we can manually add WAL checkpoints:
>   >
>   > 1. When creating the DB pools, before any read/write operations are done.
>   > 2. Before vacuuming, so the WAL has room to grow to match the DB.
>   > 3. After vacuuming, since the copied data in the WAL file has been stored in the DB.
> 
> #### RTC
> 
> - [#6003](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/6003) Add new call intents for voice only.
> 
> #### Regular dose of bug fixes
> 
> And the most notable bug fixes of the weeeeek aaaaaaaaare:
> 
> - [#6027](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/6027) Fix a double `msgtype` in a `m.location` event (a bug from `ruma`).
> - [#5996](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5996) Use the server name from the user ID as a fallback URL for fetching the well-known info.
> - [#5994](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5994) Deduplicate aggregation local and remote echo in the Timeline.
> - [#5992](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5992) Create key dirs if they don't exist in the search engine.
> - [#5858](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/5858) Utilize the Event Cache and include common relations when focusing on an event without context.
  
### matrix-bot-sdk ([website](https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-bot-sdk))

A TypeScript/JavaScript SDK for Matrix bots.

[TravisR](https://matrix.to/#/@travis:t2l.io) says

> It's been a little while, but the bot-sdk has a new release! [v0.8.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/matrix-bot-sdk/v/0.8.0) just landed to fix media downloads in our authenticated media world and to fix a bug in how crypto requests are sent to the server. 
> 
> Bots which aren't using encryption *should* be able to upgrade right away. Let me know in [#matrix-bot-sdk:t2bot.io](https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-bot-sdk:t2bot.io) if that turns out to be untrue 😅
> 
> Those using encryption however will need to make a couple of changes:
> 
> 1. When creating the `RustSdkCryptoStorageProvider`, a second parameter of `StoreType.Sqlite` *must* be supplied.
> 2. Because the older `StoreType.Sled` is no longer supported by the rust-sdk, bots will additionally need to log out, delete any stored data, and log back in with `StoreType.Sqlite`. Unfortunately, no migration is available at the moment (please PR one if able!)
> 
> This should hopefully also improve general reliability of encryption for bots. 
> 
> The full changelog is [available on github](https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-bot-sdk/releases/tag/v0.8.0), and best effort support can be found in the freshly upgraded [#matrix-bot-sdk:t2bot.io](https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-bot-sdk:t2bot.io) room. Hopefully the next release is a bit sooner than 2 years from now 😅
