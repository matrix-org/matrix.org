Hey everyone! As of last week, we are now bridging irc.gimp.org (GIMPNet) for all your GTK+/GNOME needs! It's running a bleeding-edge version of the IRC bridge which supports basic chanops syncing from IRC to Matrix. This means that if an IRC user gives chanops to a Matrix connection, the bridge will give that Matrix user moderator privileges in the room, allowing them to set the room topic/avatar/alias/etc! We hope this will make customising Matrix-bridged rooms a lot easier.

For a more complete list of current and future bridged IRC networks, see the <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/208">official wishlist</a>.
