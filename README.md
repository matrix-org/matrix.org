# Matrix.org Website

If you want to contribute to the website, make sure the problem you're trying to
fix or the feature you want to implement has been discussed in our issue tracker
and that we are interested in reviewing and merging such a contribution.

We are self-documenting our processes in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)
and how to write content for the website in [CONTENT.md](./CONTENT.md).

To discuss maintenance of this site, please come talk to us, the
[Website & Content Working Group](https://matrix.org/foundation/working-groups/#website-and-content), in
[#matrix.org-website:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#matrix.org-website:matrix.org).

## Cloning the Repository

Due to historic growth and media the repository is quite large. Therefor we
suggest the usage of `--filter=blob:none` when doing a fresh clone:

```
git clone --filter=blob:none git@github.com:matrix-org/matrix.org.git
```

This allows to only fetch the actually needed things from the git repository
instead of all of the (at the time of writing) 1.18GiB of data.
With this command at the time of writing this reduces the downloaded data to
just 612MiB.

For more information on this please check out these 2 articles which also
explain why `--depth=1` is not ideal and which implications this has:

## Building the website

Install the latest version of [Zola](https://www.getzola.org), clone the repo,
and from the root of the repo type

```
zola serve
```

Zola will build the website and start a web server, usually at
http://127.0.0.1:1111
