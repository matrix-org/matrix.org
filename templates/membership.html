                The Governing Board shall support the Guardians in their
                governance of the Foundation by ensuring that the day to day
                running of the Foundation is fair, equitable and supports the
                overall balanced growth of the Matrix ecosystem and its
                individual participants, without advantaging any specific
                players.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Governing Board shall carry out its advisory role under its
                delegated authority from the Guardians and in accordance with
                these Terms.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the avoidance of doubt, the Guardians shall be under no
                obligation to accept, act on or do anything analogous with the
                Governing Board's recommendations.
