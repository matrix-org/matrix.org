                <li>Validate the HTTP request's auth signature to protect against identity spoofing</li>

            If these checks pass, the JSON is added to the destination servers' graphs.

            Bob sends a response to Alice's message, and his server adds his
            message into his copy of the room's history, linking it to the most
            recent unlinked object in the graph - Alice's last message.
        </div>
        <div class="legend hidden" id="legend8">
            Meanwhile, Charlie also responds to Alice's message - racing with
            Bob's message.
            <br />
            Alice, Bob and Charlie's homeservers all have different views of
            the message history at this point - but Matrix is designed to
            handle this inconsistency.
        </div>
        <div class="legend hidden" id="legend9">
            Bob's homeserver relays his message through to Alice and Charlie's
            servers, who accept it.
            <br />
            At this point Alice and Bob are in sync, but Charlie's room
            history has split - both messages 2 and 3 follow on from message 1.
            This is not a problem; Charlie's client will be told about Bob's
            message and can handle it however it chooses.
        </div>
        <div class="legend hidden" id="legend10">
            Charlie's homeserver relays his message through as well, at which
            point all 3 servers have a consistent view of history again
            (including the race between Bob and Charlie). All three clients
            have seen all three messages, and the room history is now back in
            sync across the participating servers.
        </div>
        <div class="legend hidden" id="legend11">
            Later on, Alice sends another message - her homeserver adds it to
            her history, and links it to the most recent unlinked objects in
            the graph: Bob and Charlie's messages.
            <br />
            This effectively merges the
            split in history and asserts the integrity of the room (or at
            least her view of it).
        </div>
        <div class="legend hidden" id="legend12">
            Alice's message is then relayed to the other participating
            servers, which accept it and update their own history with the
            same rules, ensuring eventual consistency and integrity of the
            distributed room history.
