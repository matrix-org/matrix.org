            financial health of Matrix. Whether your organisation relies on
            Matrix for its internal communication, built a Matrix-based product,
            or want to be one of the organisations fuelling the change towards
            better online communications, you can join the Matrix.org Foundation
            as a member and run for the governing board.

                <p>
                    The Matrix Foundation maintains the Matrix Specification. It is a
                    living document everybody is encouraged to contribute to. The
                    Foundation’s Spec Core Team guides the contributors to make
                    meaningful changes to the specification that make Matrix better for
                    everyone. The team ensures that the changes work in practice and
                    that they are in line with the Matrix Manifesto.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Specification is the building plan for everyone making Matrix
                    products, and the Spec Core Team are its architects.

                    We're pragmatists who don't only work in theory. We want
                    Matrix to succeed in real life, so we make it happen in real
                    life. We provide two homeserver implementations (Synapse and
                    Dendrite), SDKs for clients, bridges and integrations in
                    various languages, provide the libraries implementing the
                    encryption Matrix relies on and get them audited.

                <p>
                    The Matrix.org Foundation provides software people can use
                    as is, and software people can use to make their own
                    products based on Matrix.

                <p>
                    We think providing software people can use is necessary, but
                    not enough to keep the Matrix community vibrant. The Matrix
                    community goes beyond clever engineers, smart developers,
                    and careful administrators.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Matrix aims to be an ubiquitous communication system. One
                    that serves everyone. One that is not just for the experts.
                    We’re happy to provide the matrix.org homeserver as an easy
                    onboarding method for people who want a quick convenient
                    set-up.

                    The strength in Matrix resides in the particular care it has for
                    interoperability. Our ecosystem is very healthy thanks to all
                    the developers and administrators creating gorgeous clients and
                    hosting their own instances of homeservers.

                    We write guides, we host Matrix Live, we publish weekly digests

                    we write and own several bridges to popular third-party
                    platforms to ease the onboarding of new communities.

                    Matrix is not only a good answer to current challenges: it
                    needs to stay relevant in the future. The Matrix.org
                    Foundation funds substantial work to make sure Matrix
                    addresses and will keep addressing actual issues.
