                    One of the most efficient ways to help improve Matrix and make
                    it reach the masses is to make a donation. We provide a neutral
                    groud for the ecosystem to gather and discuss the specification,
                    we provide a server to let less tech-savvy people join the
                    federation, and we spread the word at events and conferences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you believe in what we do and want to support us in our
                    mission, a donation, even small, can go a long way.

                    If you have a stake in Matrix, become a member of the Foundation
                    and run for the Governing Board to have a say in the direction
                    of the project.

                <p>
                    An organizational membership offers additional perks, such as a
                    logo on our website and discounts when organizing our annual
                    conference.

                    Working groups are where you can help get things done. Having a
                    direction is great, having hands to implement it is even better.

                    Whether you like to get your hands dirty in code, you like to

                    for more friends to help us move Matrix where it ought to be.

                    To give Matrix a go, your friends needs to know it exists. You
                    can help us spread the word about Matrix by proudly wearing a
                    Matrix logo on your t-shirt, hoodie, or by placing stickers on
                    your laptop.

                    Note that the Foundation doesn't make significant profit from
                    merch sales. If your primary goal is to support our work,
                    donations have a much higher impact.
