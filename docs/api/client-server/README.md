This directory contains the swagger UI viewer from https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui as of commit 40bd4581419b9d2845d852832a7cb8c0cee43867

The json directory contains the output of the matrix-doc repository's scripts/dump-swagger.py script.

The matrix.org styling was applied using a slightly hacked version of matrix.org's scripts/add-matrix-org-stylings.sh but this should be cleaned up because it's really ugly.
