# update_docs.sh: regenerates the autogenerated files on the matrix.org site.
# At present this includes:
#
#   * the spec intro and appendices, at https://matrix.org/docs/spec/ and
#      https://matrix.org/docs/spec/appendices (though note that it is planned
#      to move these to https://spec.matrix.org)
#
#   * the guides and howtos at https://matrix.org/docs/develop/
#
#   * the RapiDoc UI for the API
#
# Note that the historical versions of the CS spec and swagger, and the spec
# index, are generated manually within matrix-doc and then *committed to git*.

# Note that this file is world-readable unless someone plays some .htaccess hijinks
