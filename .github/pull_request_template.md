**:heavy_check_mark: Checklist**

- Check for common mistakes:
  - [ ] Wrap plain URLs in `<>` to linkify them ([learn more](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/blob/main/CONTENT.md#publishing-to-the-blog)).
  - [ ] Use the right level of headings: The page title will use a level 1 headings, so your headings should use level 2 and below.
  - [ ] Use internal links: when linking to another page on <https://matrix.org>, use the Zola `[label](@/target.md)` [syntax](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/linking/#internal-links).
- For blog posts:
  - [ ] Verify the date and post ordering on the `/blog` page, especially for multiple posts on the same day. Prefer UTC format, e.g. `2025-12-01T14:00:00Z` for Dec 1st, 2025, 2pm UTC.
  - [ ] Set the correct author and category. Browse existing ones at <https://matrix.org/author/> and <https://matrix.org/category/> to match them.
- [ ] If you are holding one or more roles in the Matrix ecosystem, espescially when contributing on behalf of a team or organisation, please let us know. See [example](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/pull/2788).
- [ ] Let us know if your PR is time-sensitive in any way.
- [ ] Mention any issues related to the PR. Use [GitHub keywords](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) as appropriate.
- [ ] Your individual commits or pull request is [signed off](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix.org/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
