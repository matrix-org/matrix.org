# This is Matrix

Matrix is an open source project that publishes the
[Matrix open standard](https://spec.matrix.org) for secure, decentralised, real-time communication, and its Apache licensed
[reference implementations](https://github.com/matrix-org).

Maintained by the non-profit [Matrix.org Foundation](/foundation/), we aim
to create an open platform which is as independent, vibrant and evolving as the Web itself... but for communication.

As of June 2019, Matrix is [out of beta](/blog/2019/06/11/introducing-matrix-1-0-and-the-matrix-org-foundation), and the
protocol is fully suitable for production usage.
