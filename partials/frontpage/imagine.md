# _Imagine a world..._

- _...where it is as simple to message or call anyone as it is to send them an email._
- _...where you can communicate without being forced to install the same app._
- _...where you can choose who hosts your communication._
- _...where your conversations are secured by E2E encryption._
- _...where thereâ€™s a simple standard HTTP API for sharing real-time data on the web._
