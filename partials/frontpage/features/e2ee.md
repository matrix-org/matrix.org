## End-to-end encryption

</div>

Matrix provides state-of-the-art end-to-end-encryption via the
[Olm](https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm/blob/master/docs/olm.md) and
[Megolm](https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm/blob/master/docs/megolm.md) cryptographic ratchets.
This ensures that only the intended recipients can ever decrypt your messages,
while warning if any unexpected devices are added to the conversation.

Matrixâ€™s encryption is based on the [Double Ratchet Algorithm](https://signal.org/docs/specifications/doubleratchet/)
popularised by Signal,
but extended to support encryption to rooms containing thousands of devices.
Olm and Megolm are specified as an [open standard](https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm/blob/master/docs/) and
[implementations](https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm/) are released under the Apache license,
[independently audited by NCC Group](/blog/2016/11/21/matrixs-olm-end-to-end-encryption-security-assessment-released-and-implemented-cross-platform-on-riot-at-last).
