## IOT, VR and more

Matrix can handle any type of real-time data, not only messaging and VoIP.

By building bridges to as many IoT silos as possible, data can be securely published on the Matrix network.
IoT solutions built on Matrix are unified, rather than locked to specific vendors,
and can even publish or consume Matrix data directly from devices via
[ultra-low bandwidth transports](/blog/2019/03/12/breaking-the-100-bps-barrier-with-matrix-meshsim-coap-proxy)
(100bps or less)

Meanwhile AR and VR vendors are recreating the silos weâ€™ve seen in instant messaging
rather than working together towards an open ecosystem.
Matrix can be the unifying layer for both communication and world data in [AR and VR](/blog/2017/04/04/opening-up-cyberspace-with-matrix-and-webvr).
