## Messaging

</div>

Matrix gives you simple [HTTP APIs](https://spec.matrix.org) and [SDKs](/sdks/) (iOS, Android, Web) to create chatrooms,
direct chats and chat bots, complete with end-to-end encryption, file transfer,
synchronised conversation history, formatted messages, read receipts and more.

Conversations are replicated over all the servers participating in them, meaning there are no single point of control or
failure. You can reach any other user in the global Matrix ecosystem of over 40M users,
even including those on other networks via [bridges](/bridges/).
