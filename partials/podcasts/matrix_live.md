## Matrix Live

Every Friday we release a new episode of Matrix Live, to talk about the status
of Matrix, what's happening in the ecosystem and more. If you're interested in
**following the development of the protocol, what actors of the Matrix ecosystem
are working on, or if you want to have a glimpse at the new features coming in
your favourite Matrix clients**, Matrix Live is for you!

You can subscribe to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/Matrixdotorg/videos)
