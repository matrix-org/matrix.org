## Open Tech Will Save Us

Every last Wednesday of the month, at 18:00 Paris time we broadcasted Open Tech
Will Save Us, our live show with guests from the broader open source world. We
try to **understand the social impact of software and how open source can make
it more positive**.

This show is for every open source enthusiast, whether they want to hear about
the latest Thunderbird release or why single-sign-on is such a big deal in the
corporate world.

Head to [the Open Tech Will Save Us](/podcasts/otwsu/) page to catch up with the
previous issues. Open Tech Will Save Us is currently paused, and will be resumed
once we have enough resources to restart it. If OTWSU was valuable to you and
you can afford it, please head to the [support page](/support) and consider
contributing to our sustainability.
