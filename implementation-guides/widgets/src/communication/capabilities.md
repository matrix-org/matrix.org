# Capabilities

As part of establishing a session for widgets and clients to communicate with each other, a
capabilities negotation happens where the client asks the widget what permissions it wants and
the widget replies with its ideal set. The client is then supposed to ask the user what permissions
to grant, or if it's obvious for certain widgets, approve them implicitly.

The widget specification has a list of available capabilities.
