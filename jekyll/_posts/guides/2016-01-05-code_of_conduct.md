# Matrix Code of Conduct

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the Matrix community, as well as steps for reporting unacceptable behaviour. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all, and expect our code of conduct to be honoured. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned from the community.

This applies to conversation in the any room in the matrix community ([+matrix:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/+matrix:matrix.org)) and commits and comments relating to any project in the [matrix-org](https://github.com/matrix-org) github space.
 
Our open source community strives to:

* **Be friendly and patient.**
* **Be welcoming**: We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports all people.
* **Be considerate**: Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else's primary language.
* **Be courteous**:  Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behaviour and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
* **Be careful in the words that we choose**: Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment is not acceptable.
* **Try to understand why we disagree**: Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of our community comes from its diversity, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.

## Definitions

harass
> "v.t. To torment by or as by importunity; to worry, to molest; to tire out with care or worry." [1]

which is to say, but is not limited to:

- Importunate offensive/unwelcome comments
- Stalking or following
- Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes
- Sustained disruption of discussion
- Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
- Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease

An act may be unacceptable without it constituting harassment, though it may also form part of harassing behaviour, for example:

- (simulated) Physical contact after a request to stop or to not start
- Threats of violence, both physical and psychological
- Incitement of violence towards any individual, including the self 
- Deliberate intimidation
- Unwelcome sexual attention, including gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour
- Publication of non-harassing private communication

|

We will not act on complaints regarding:

- Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you”
- Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial

|

### Diversity Statement

We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community for all. 

|

### Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour — or have any other concerns — please report it by contacting us via abuse@matrix.org. All reports will be handled with discretion. In your report please include:

- Your contact information.
- Names (usernames and nicks, real names, and/or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there are additional witnesses, please
include them as well. Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. 
- The date and time of the incident (or start of incident).
- Any additional information that may be helpful.

After filing a report, a representative will contact you personally, review the incident, follow up with any additional questions, and make a decision as to how to respond. If the person who is harassing you is part of the response team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. If the complaint originates from a member of the response team, it will be handled by a different member of the response team. We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.
