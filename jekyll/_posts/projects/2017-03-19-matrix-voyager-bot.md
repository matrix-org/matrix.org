# {{ page.title }}

Voyager is a bot that travels the network by looking for rooms it can join. When the bot sees a message with a room alias, it will try to join the room to gather more links to rooms.

Check out [the current graph](https://voyager.t2bot.io), or ask questions in [#voyager:t2l.io](https://matrix.to/#/#voyager:t2l.io). Voyager is not meant to be an intrusive bot, and is more than happy to automatically de-list a room when kicked or banned.

The source (and more information) can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/turt2live/matrix-voyager-bot).
