# {{ page.title }}
Rocket Sheep is a purpose-built matrix bot intended for makerspaces/hackerspaces. It has a long list of features planned, but here are some of ones available today:
* Announcements when someone enters the building
* Querying of IP cameras by using Blue Iris
* Interacting with Honeywell thermostats to show the current temperature in the space

The source, and more information, can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/ENTS-Source/rocket-sheep). Pop by [#ents:tang.ents.ca](https://matrix.to/#/#ents:tang.ents.ca) with any questions.
