                What is Matrix?
              </h4>
              <p>
                Matrix is an open standard for interoperable, decentralised,
                real-time communication over IP. It can be used to power Instant
                Messaging, VoIP/WebRTC signalling, Internet of Things
                communication - or anywhere you need a standard HTTP API for
                publishing and subscribing to data whilst tracking the
                conversation history.
              </p>
              <p>
                Matrix defines the standard, and provides open source reference
                implementations of Matrix-compatible Servers,{" "}
                <a href="https://matrix.org/sdks/">Client SDKs</a> and
                Application Services to help you create new communication
                solutions or extend the capabilities and reach of existing ones.

                What is Matrix's Mission?
              </h4>
              <p>
                Matrixâ€™s initial goal is to fix the problem of fragmented IP
                communications: letting users message and call each other
                without having to care what app the other user is on - making it
                as easy as sending an email.
              </p>
              <p>
                The longer term goal is for Matrix to act as a generic HTTP
                messaging and data synchronisation system for the whole web -
                allowing people, services and devices to easily communicate with
                each other, empowering users to own and control their data and
                select the services and vendors they want to use.

                What does federated mean?
              </h4>
              <p>
                Federation allows separate deployments of a communication
                service to communicate with each other - for instance a mail
                server run by Google federates with a mail server run by
                Microsoft when you send email from @gmail.com to @hotmail.com.
              </p>
              <p>
                <a href="#definitions">interoperable</a> clients may simply be
                running on the same deployment - whereas in federation the
                deployments themselves are exchanging data in a compatible
                manner.
              </p>
              <p>
                Matrix provides open federation - meaning that anyone on the
                internet can join into the Matrix ecosystem by deploying their
                own server.

                    Federation means that separate instances of a service
                    communicate - the best example of this is email servers, in
                    which it's possible to send mail between difference service
                    providers. For Matrix, this means that data about rooms and
                    message history is shared between servers of participating
                    users.

                Early email systems behaved as isolated communities which only
                allowed you to exchange mail with users on the same system. If
                you got your email from one service and your friend from
                another, then you couldn't message each other. This is basically
                the situation we're in today with VoIP and IM.

                    matrix.org core team. It is currently by far the most
                    installed homeserver available.

                    Users in Matrix use one or more clients to communicate. This
                    could be any combination of a web client, a command line
                    client, a mobile client - or embedded clients built into
                    existing apps. It could even be a piece of hardware (e.g. a
                    drone) that is Matrix enabled.

                The drawback is that Element has to pull for new messages, which
                can drain your battery. To counter this, you can change the
                delay between polls in the settings. Higher delay means better
                battery life (but may delay receiving messages). You can also
                disable the background sync entirely (which means that you won't
                get any notifications at all).

              <p>
                HTTP may not be the most efficient transport, but it is
                ubiquitous, very well understood and has numerous
                implementations on almost every platform and language. It also
                has a simple upgrade path to HTTP/2, which is relatively
                bandwidth and round-trip efficient.
              </p>
              <p>
                For these reasons it has been chosen as the mandatory baseline
                of the exchange, but it is still entirely possible to use other
                protocols for communication between clients and server (see for
                example this{" "}

                </a>
                ), and it's also possible in the future that negotiation of more
                efficient protocols will be added for the{" "}

                HTTPS traffic. Look at{" "}
                <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/develop/docs/federate.md">
                  &quot;Setting up Federation&quot;
                </a>{" "}
                in the Synapse docs for details.
              </p>
              <p>
                Client&lt;-&gt;Server traffic can talk directly to Synapse via
                port 8448, but as by default Synapse creates a self-signed TLS
                certificate this can cause problems for clients which can't
                easily trust self-signed certificates (e.g. most web browsers).
                Instead, you can proxy access to Synapse's HTTP listener on port
                8008 via an existing HTTPS proxy with a valid certificate (e.g.
                an nginx listening on port 443), or you can point Synapse at a
                valid X.509 signed TLS certificate. In future, Synapse will
                probably use letsencrypt to autogenerate valid certificates
                rather than self-signed ones during installation, simplifying
                this process enormously.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can also put Synapse entirely behind an existing TLS load
                balancer and not expose port 8448 at all. In this situation,
                Synapse will need to be configured to share the same{" "}
                <em>public</em> TLS certificate as the load balancer (as Synapse
                uses the public certificate for identity in other areas too, and
                it has to match the certificate that other servers see when they
                connect).

                    Federation means that separate instances of a service
                    communicate - the best example of this is email servers, in
                    which it's possible to send mail between difference service
                    providers. For Matrix, this means that data about rooms and
                    message history is shared between servers of participating
                    users.

                    Federation means that separate instances of a service
                    communicate - the best example of this is email servers, in
                    which it's possible to send mail between difference service
                    providers. For Matrix, this means that data about rooms and
                    message history is shared between servers of participating
                    users.

                What is the difference between Matrix and XMPP?
              </h4>
              <p>
                We think of Matrix and <a href="#definitions">XMPP</a> as being
                quite different; at its core Matrix can be thought of as an
                eventually consistent global JSON database with an HTTP API
                and <a href="#definitions">pubsub</a> semantics - whilst XMPP
                can be thought of as a message passing protocol. You can use
                them both to build chat systems; you can use them both to build
                pubsub systems; each comes with different tradeoffs. Matrix has
                a deliberately extensive 'kitchen sink' baseline of
                functionality; XMPP has a deliberately minimal baseline set of
                functionality. If XMPP does what you need it to do, then we're
                genuinely happy for you! Meanwhile, rather than competing, an
                XMPP Bridge like <a href="https://github.com/SkaveRat/xmpptrix">
                  Skaverat's xmpptrix beta
                </a>{" "}
                or{" "}

                has potential to let both environments coexist and make the most
                of each other's benefits.
              </p>
              <p>
                The whole area of XMPP vs Matrix is quite subjective. Rather
                than fighting over which open interoperable communication
                standard works the best, we should just collaborate and bridge
                everything together. The more federation and interoperability
                the better.

                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP">XMPP</a> is a
                    communication protocol for message-oriented middleware based
                    on XML. We think of Matrix and XMPP as being quite
                    different; at its core Matrix can be thought of as an
                    eventually consistent global JSON db, whilst XMPP can be

                    The publish-subscribe pattern describes an architecture in
                    which message senders push messages to a location, without
                    needing to know who the subscribers will be. For Matrix,
                    this means a client can send a message to a room without
                    knowing the members, and the members can read that message.

              </h4>
              <p>
                Trillian and Pidgin and similar aggregating IM clients merge all
                your IM activity into a single app. However, your history and
                identity is still fragmented across the networks. People can't
                find you easily, and your history is fragmented (other than on
                the device where the client runs). And rather than being able to
                chose the right app for the job when communicating with people,
                you are pushed towards relying on a specific aggregation app.
              </p>
              <p>
                Matrix lets you get the best of both worlds by linking to all
                the different networks (XMPP, AIM, ICQ, Lync, Skype etc) on the
                serverside, using bridges which can be run by anyone. Matrix
                then provides a simple standard HTTP API to access any of these
                networks, and lets you choose whichever client you prefer
                (either as a 'native' Matrix client or using a non-Matrix client
                from one of the networks which has been bridged in).

                <a href="#definitions">3PID</a> namespaces such as email
                addresses or phone numbers should be used publicly to identify
                Matrix users, at least for invitation purposes. A Matrix
                &quot;Identity&quot; describes both the user ID and any other
                existing IDs from third party namespaces linked to their
                account.
              </p>
              <p>
                Matrix users can link third-party IDs (3PIDs) to their user ID.
                Linking 3PIDs creates a mapping from a 3PID to a user ID. This
                mapping can then be used by Matrix users in order to discover
                the MXIDs of their contacts.
              </p>
              <p>
                In order to ensure that the mapping from 3PID to user ID is
                genuine, the intention is for a globally federated cluster of
                trusted &quot;Identity Servers&quot; (IS) be used to verify the
                3PID and persist and replicate the mappings. Usage of an IS is
                not required in order for a client application to be part of the
                Matrix ecosystem. However, without one clients will not be able
                to look up user IDs using 3PIDs.
              </p>
              <p>
                The precise architecture of identity servers is currently in

                    Users in Matrix use one or more clients to communicate. This

                    Federation means that separate instances of a service
                    communicate - the best example of this is email servers, in
                    which it's possible to send mail between difference service
                    providers. For Matrix, this means that data about rooms and
                    message history is shared between servers of participating
                    users.

                Since events are extensible it is possible for malicious users
                and/or servers to add keys that are, for example offensive or
                illegal. Since some events cannot be simply deleted (e.g.
                membership events) we instead 'redact' events, essentially
                stripping the event of all keys that are not required by the
                protocol. Redacting an event cannot be undone, allowing server
                owners to also delete the offending content from the databases.

              <p>
                Voice (and video) over Matrix uses the WebRTC 1.0 standard to
                transfer call media (i.e. the actual voice and video traffic).
                Matrix is used to signal the establishment and termination of
                the call by sending call events, like any other event.

                Why is the state_groups_state table so large? What is it

              <p>
                Room state takes up a lot of space! To be specific, regular
                snapshots are taken of room states, so you can rapidly find out
                the state for historical events.
              </p>
              <p>
                Why is it so important to record this, and to know the past room
                state including full member list?
              </p>
              <p>
                It's needed to enable access control and state resolution, for
                example the homeserver needs to be able to decide:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  &quot;who can see this message at that point in time?&quot;
                </li>
                <li>
                  &quot;what was the state of the room was when this message was
                  received, and so is it <em>allowed</em> to be received?&quot;

              </ul>

                Synapse stores these snapshots approximately every 100 messages,
