            <h1>Security Disclosure Policy</h1>
            <p>Matrix.org greatly appreciates investigative work into security vulnerabilities carried out by well-intentioned, ethical security researchers. We follow the practice of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure'>responsible disclosure</a> in order to best protect Matrix’s user-base from the impact of security issues.  On our side, this means:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We will respond to security incidents as a priority.</li>
                <li>We will fix the issue as soon as is practical, keeping in mind that not all risks are created equal.</li>
                <li>We will always transparently let the community know about any incident that affects them.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you have found a security vulnerability in Matrix, we ask that you disclose it responsibly by emailing <a href='mailto:security@matrix.org'>security@matrix.org</a>.
            Optionally, if you want to encrypt your email, you can use our <a href="/.well-known/pgp-key.txt">PGP key</a>.
            Please do not discuss potential vulnerabilities in public without validating with us first.</p>
            <p>On receipt the security team will:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Review the report, verify the vulnerability and respond with confirmation and/or further information requests; we typically reply within 24 hours. </li>
                <li>Once the reported security bug has been addressed we will notify the Researcher, who is then welcome to optionally disclose publicly.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The following is a list of known issues and/or things we do not consider to be an issue. Please <em>do not</em> send reports regarding the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Issues relating to SPF or DMARC.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Matrix.org Foundation does not ordinarily provide bug bounties, though organisations building on top of Matrix may do so in future.</p>
            <p>We maintain a Hall of Fame to recognise those who have responsibly disclosed security issues to us in the past.</p>
