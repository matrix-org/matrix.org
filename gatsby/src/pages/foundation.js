          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p className="mxblock--foundation__p">
            The evolution of Matrix is managed through an open governance process, looked after by The Matrix.org
            Foundation - a non-profit UK Community Interest Company, incorporated to act as the neutral guardian of the
            standard on behalf of the whole Matrix community.
          </p>
          <p className="mxblock--foundation__p">
            The Foundation defines the manifesto, mission and values of the project, the open governance process that
            determines how the specification develops, and provides a safety-net to ensure the project stays independent
            and true to its goals.  The constitution of the project is defined in the Foundation’s legal Articles of
            Association and Rules, and is enforced by the Guardians of Matrix: the directors of the Foundation appointed
            to provide a balance of independent experts and the founding Matrix team to ensure the project stays on
            track.
          </p>

          <h2>The Guardians</h2>

          <p className="mxblock--foundation__p">
            The Guardians are the legal directors of the non-profit Foundation, and are responsible for ensuring that
            the Foundation (and by extension the Spec Core Team) keeps on mission and neutrally protects the development
            of Matrix. Guardians are typically independent of the commercial Matrix ecosystem and may even not be
            members of today’s Matrix community, but are deeply aligned with the mission of the project. Guardians are
            selected to be respected and trusted by the wider community to uphold the guiding principles of the
            Foundation and keep the other Guardians honest.

            </ul>
            <h2>The Rules of the Foundation</h2>
            <p>The Foundation is governed by two sets of documents - its Articles of Association, which define its legal
              structure and processes, and its Rules, which define the scope and mechanisms of its day-to-day
              activity.</p>
            <p>The Rules were originally drafted through the open <a href=
              "https://matrix.org/docs/spec/proposals">Matrix Specification Change</a> proposal process in order
              to provide full transparency and review from the wider community. The result was <a href=
              "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/pull/1779">MSC1779</a> - <a href=
              "https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/tree/master/proposals/1779-open-governance.md"> Proposal for
              Open Governance of Matrix.org</a> , providing a comprehensive overview of the whole governance
              process.</p>
          <p>The Proposal for Open Governance was then formalised into legal form and incorporated into the Articles of
            Association and a matching Rules document, which is canonically versioned in <a href=
            "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MhqsuIUxPc7Vf_y8D250mKZlLeQS6E39DPY6Azpc2NY/edit"> this Google
            Doc</a> (for ease of use by lawyers). This is the official canonical version of the rulebook referred
            to by the Foundation’s Articles.</p>

          <p>One of the most important items defined in the Rules are The Guiding Principles of the project and the
            definition of the Spec Core Team, which are reproduced below from MSC1779 for ease of reference.</p>

          <h2>Matrix Manifesto</h2>

          <p>We believe:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>People should have full control over their own
            communication.</li>
            <li>People should not be locked into centralised communication
              silos, but instead be free to pick who they choose to host their
            communication without limiting who they can reach.</li>
            <li>The ability to converse securely and privately is a basic human
            right.</li>
            <li>Communication should be available to everyone as a free and
            open, unencumbered, standard and global network.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Mission</h2>
          <p>The Matrix.org Foundation exists to act as a neutral custodian
            for Matrix and to nurture it as efficiently as possible as a single
            unfragmented standard, for the greater benefit of the whole
            ecosystem, not benefiting or privileging any single player or
          subset of players.</p>
          <p>For clarity: the Matrix ecosystem is defined as anyone who uses
          the Matrix protocol. This includes (non-exhaustively):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>End-users of Matrix clients.</li>
            <li>Matrix client developers and testers.</li>
            <li>Spec developers.</li>
            <li>Server admins.</li>
            <li>Matrix packagers & maintainers.</li>
            <li>Companies building products or services on Matrix.</li>
            <li>Bridge developers.</li>
            <li>Bot developers.</li>
            <li>Widget developers.</li>
            <li>Server developers.</li>
            <li>Matrix room and community moderators.</li>
            <li>End-users who are using Matrix indirectly via bridges.</li>
            <li>External systems which are bridged into Matrix.</li>
            <li>Anyone using Matrix for data communications.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>"Greater benefit" is defined as maximising:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>the number of Matrix-native end-users reachable on the open
            Matrix network.</li>
            <li>the number of regular users on the Matrix network (e.g. 30-day
            retained federated users).</li>
            <li>the number of online servers in the open federation.</li>
            <li>the number of developers building on Matrix.</li>
            <li>the number of independent implementations which use
            Matrix.</li>
            <li>the number of bridged end-users reachable on the open Matrix
            network.</li>
            <li>the signal-to-noise ratio of the content on the open Matrix
            network (i.e. minimising spam).</li>
            <li>the ability for users to discover content on their terms
            (empowering them to select what to see and what not to see).</li>
            <li>the quality and utility of the Matrix spec (as defined by ease
              and ability with which a developer can implement spec-compliant
              clients, servers, bots, bridges, and other integrations without
            needing to refer to any other external material).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>N.B. that we consider success to be the growth of the open
            federated network rather than closed deployments. For example, if
            WhatsApp adopted Matrix it wouldn’t be a complete win unless they
          openly federated with the rest of the Matrix network.</p>

          <h2>Values</h2>
          <p>As Matrix evolves, it's critical that the Spec Core Team and
            Guardians are aligned on the overall philosophy of the project,
            particularly in more subjective areas. The values we follow
          are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Supporting the whole long-term ecosystem rather than individual
            stakeholder gain.</li>
            <li>Openness rather than proprietary lock-in.</li>
            <li>Interoperability rather than fragmentation.</li>
            <li>Cross-platform rather than platform-specific.</li>
            <li>Collaboration rather than competition.</li>
            <li>Accessibility rather than elitism.</li>
            <li>Transparency rather than stealth.</li>
            <li>Empathy rather than contrariness.</li>
            <li>Pragmatism rather than perfection.</li>
            <li>Proof rather than conjecture.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Patent encumbered IP is strictly prohibited from being added to
          the standard.</p>
          <p>Making the specification rely on non-standard/unspecified
            behaviour of other systems or actors (such as SaaS services, even
            open-sourced, not governed by a standard protocol) shall not be
          accepted, either.</p>

          <h2>The Spec Core Team</h2>
          <p>The contents and direction of the Matrix Spec is governed by the
            Spec Core Team; a set of experts from across the whole Matrix
            community, representing all aspects of the Matrix ecosystem. The
          Spec Core Team acts as a subcommittee of the Foundation.</p>
          <p>Members of the Spec Core Team pledge to act as a neutral
            custodian for Matrix on behalf of the whole ecosystem and uphold
            the Guiding Principles of the project as outlined above. In
            particular, they agree to drive the adoption of Matrix as a single
            global federation, an open standard unencumbered from any
            proprietary IP or software patents, minimising fragmentation
            (whilst encouraging experimentation), evolving rapidly, and
            prioritising the long-term success and growth of the overall
          network over individual commercial concerns.</p>
          <p>Spec Core Team members need to have significant proven domain
            experience/skill and have had clear dedication and commitment to
            the project and community for &gt;6 months. (In future, once we
            have subteams a la Rust, folks need to have proven themselves there
          first).</p>
          <p>Members need to demonstrate ability to work constructively with
            the rest of the team; we want participation in the Spec Core Team
            to be an efficient, pleasant and productive place, even in the face
            of inevitable disagreement. We do not want a toxic culture of
            bullying or competitive infighting. Folks need to be able to
            compromise; we are not building a culture of folks pushing their
          personal agendas at the expense of the overall project.</p>
          <p>The team should be particularly vigilant against 'trojan horse'
            additions to the spec - features which only benefit particular
            players, or are designed to somehow cripple or fragment the open
            protocol and ecosystem in favour of competitive advantage.
            Commercial players are of course free to build proprietary
            implementations, or use custom event types, or even custom API
            extensions (e.g. more efficient network transports) - but
            implementations must fall back to interoperating correctly with the
          rest of the ecosystem.</p>
