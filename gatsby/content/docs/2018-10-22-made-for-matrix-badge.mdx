## Preferred Badge

Use the preferred black badge in your marketing materials. When using the badge on your website, link the badge to https://matrix.org using the `target=”_blank”` attribute.

## Inverted Badge

If the preferred black badge isn’t legible in your layout, for example because your background is too dark, instead use the inverted badge, displayed above on a grey background.

## Graphic Standards

Minimum clear space is equal to one-quarter the height of the badge. Don't place photos, typography, or other graphic elements inside the minimum clear space. Do not stretch or alter the aspect ratio of the badge.
