- We will speak about the relevance of open standards with **Italo from The 
     Document Foundation** and how it works in practice with the OpenDocument
     format. Who are open standards for? Are there cases when open standards
     can be a problem? Are they just a technical matter? Let's find out!
- Pending answer from another guest :)
- **Half-Shot from Element** is the author of the hookshot projectâ€¦ and it loves
     open standards! Hookshot is a multi-purpose bridge which thrives when it
     can use open APIs and open standards. How does interoperability help
     bringing value? Half-Shot will show us in practice!
