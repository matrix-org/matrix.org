- We will speak about the relevance of open standards with **Italo from The 
     Document Foundation** and how it works in practice with the OpenDocument
     format. Who are open standards for? Are there cases when open standards
     can be a problem? Are they just a technical matter? Let's find out!
- **Jean-Marc Liotier from Openstreetmap** has a lot to tell us not only about
     open standards but also about open data. Let's dive in the open map project
     and see what collaboration can bring to citizens and organisations at large.
- **Half-Shot from Element** is the author of the hookshot project… and it loves
     open standards! Hookshot is a multi-purpose bridge which thrives when it
     can use open APIs and open standards. How does interoperability help
     bringing value? Half-Shot will show us in practice!
