A special episode of Open Tech Will Save Us on the topic of **moderation**. This
can be a loaded termâ€¦ and not everyone agrees on what moderation even is. We
will explore with our guest what moderation is, what it means to moderate online
communities, if it applies to decentralised projects as well, and will end up
with practical examples on Matrix.
