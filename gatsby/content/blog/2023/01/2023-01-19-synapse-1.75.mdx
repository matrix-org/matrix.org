And here is the time for another Synapse upgrade to [version
1.75](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.75.0).
It seems like the blog post for [version 1.74](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.74.0)
 was eaten by Santa Claus, so this post will also cover changes from it.

## Announcements

### ICU dependency for improved user search

Synapse 1.74 introduced support for an optional improved user search experience by taking into
account Unicode, those allowing search of non ASCII characters.

To do so, Synapse used the [ICU library](https://icu.unicode.org/) through its Python binding library, [PyICU](https://pypi.org/project/PyICU/).

To use it you need to install the development package of the ICU library,
and install the optional Synapse functionality through `pip install matrix-synapse[user-search]` for a PyPI install.

Please refer to the [upgrade notes](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.75/upgrade.html#unicode-support-in-user-search) for more info.

## The new stuff

### Support [RFC7636](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636) Proof Key for Code Exchange for OAuth single sign-on

Synapse 1.75 adds support for RFC7636 code challenges in the OAuth 2.0 flow.

This is required by Twitter SSO and enabling it can protect against certain attacks. 

### Experimental support for removing account data ([MSC3391](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3391))

Experimental support for removing account data has landed in Synapse.
It was previously possible to create or update account data but not remove them, this is now possible.

The support is experimental and needs to be enabled with a configuration flag since the MSC hasn't landed yet.

### More faster remote room joins fixes and improvements

In case you missed it we are working on dramatically improve performance of remote room joins, you can refer
to [this blog post](https://matrix.org/blog/2022/10/18/testing-faster-remote-room-joins) for more details.

Last versions of Synapse brings that a lot closer to release thanks to work in progress to support it
with workers, and also several small fixes.

## Everything else

See the full [changelog](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.75.0), for a
complete list of changes in the release. Also please have a look at the [upgrade
notes](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.75/upgrade.html#upgrading-to-v1740) for 1.74 version.

Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our

order) INSERT LIST !!
as well as anyone helping us make Synapse better by sharing their feedback and reporting issues.
