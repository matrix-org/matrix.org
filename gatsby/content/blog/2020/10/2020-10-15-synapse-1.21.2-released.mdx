Hi folks,

Today we have released Synapse 1.21.2, which fixes a couple of minor bugs that crept into the previous release. Full details are below.

Separately, we are advising any administrators who have not yet upgraded to Synapse 1.21.0 or later to do so as soon as possible. Previous versions of Synapse were vulnerable to a cross-site-scripting (XSS) attack; the bug was fixed in Snapse 1.21.0.

The changelog for 1.21.2 is as follows:

Synapse 1.21.2 (2020-10-15)
