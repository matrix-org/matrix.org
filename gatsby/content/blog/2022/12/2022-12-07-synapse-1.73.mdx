And here is another update to your beloved Matrix homeserver implementation, [Synapse
1.73](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.73.0).

## Announcements

### Legacy Prometheus metric names removed

As mentioned in the [Synapse 1.72 release blog post](https://matrix.org/blog/2022/11/22/synapse-1-72-released#announcements), after disabling comes removing!

`enable_legacy_metrics` has been removed, sorry if it breaks your dashboard but
the upgrade should not be that difficult, and you got some heads-up.

You can still find the full list of renamed metrics
[here](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.73/metrics-howto.html#renaming-of-metrics--deprecation-of-old-names-in-12).

## The new stuff

### Performance

A bunch of performance improvements have been included in this release.
You can expect `/messages` to be [quite faster](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/14527).

Various optimizations have also been done on fetching aggregations of relationships.

### Extensible Events experimental support

Experimental support for Extensible Events has landed in Synapse.

This is exciting since this global rework of events presentation has been in talks
[for a while](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1767), and
having an implementation to experiment with greatly helps bringing the feature
closer to completion.

Note that this support is still very much experimental as the related MSCs are still
under review and could change at any time, and therefore not recommended for use
in production.

## Everything else

See the full [changelog](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.73.0), for a
complete list of changes in the release.

Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our

order) [schmop](https://github.com/schmop), [Ashish Kumar](https://github.com/ashfame),
