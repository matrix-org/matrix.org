And here is another update to your beloved Matrix server implementation, [Synapse
1.73](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.73.0).

## Announcements

### Legacy Prometheus metric names removed

As mentioned in previous blogpost, after disabling comes removing !

`enable_legacy_metrics` has been removed, sorry if it breaks your dashboard but
the upgrade should not be that difficult, and you got some heads-up.

You can still find the full list of renamed metrics
[here](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.73/metrics-howto.html#renaming-of-metrics--deprecation-of-old-names-in-12).

## The new stuff

### Performance

A bunch of performance improvements have been included in this release.
You can expect `/messages` to be [quite faster](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/pull/14527).

Various optimizations have also been done on fetching aggregations of relationships.

### Extensible Events experimental support

Experimental support for Extensible Events has landed in Synapse.

This is exciting since this global rework of events presentation has been in talk
[for a while](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/1767), and we now have an
implementation to experiment with that.

Beware that experimental is not a joke here, since the related MSCs hasn't even landed yet,
and this has been implemented more to validate the approach than anything else.

If you are not a developer that wants to begin working on supporting them,
please avoid enabling this since it will be useless to you and could be buggy.

## Everything else

See the full [changelog](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.73.0), for a
complete list of changes in the release.

Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our
thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including (in no particular
order) [schmop](https://github.com/schmop), [Ashish Kumar](https://github.com/ashfame),
[realtyem](https://github.com/realtyem), and [Brennan Chapman](https://github.com/chapb)
as well as anyone helping us make Synapse better by sharing their feedback and reporting issues.
