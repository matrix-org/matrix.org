<p>
Hey all,
</p>
<p>
It‚Äôs finally here: <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.4/client-server-api/#threading">threads</a>, <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.4/client-server-api/#event-replacements">edits</a>, and <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.4/client-server-api/#private-read-receipts">private read receipts</a>. v1.4 has been a little later than usual in the quarter because we wanted to make sure we nailed down all the core MSCs for threads before publishing the spec itself, but we‚Äôve done that now and we‚Äôre excited about it.
</p>
<p>
Matrix 1.3 was <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/06/16/matrix-v-1-3-release">just over 3 months ago</a>, though with the relatively large features there and the colossal implementation effort of v1.4 we‚Äôre not expecting everyone to have implementations on day 1. Instead, as with all spec releases, we encourage implementations to gradually update over the next few months. We‚Äôre additionally planning to make v1.5 (Q4 2022) more of a maintenance update to help make the backlog a bit easier on everyone, though we might prioritize a couple cool features in there too :)
</p>
<p>
Matrix 1.4 sees 14 MSCs get merged, but we can‚Äôt possibly go into detail on them all here. We‚Äôve instead focused on the 3 major features we‚Äôre excited about - check out the changelog at the end for the full picture.
</p>
<h2>üßµ Threads</h2>


<p>
<a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.4/client-server-api/#threading">Threads</a>, a critical feature in terms of parity with other chat systems, have landed thanks to a whopping 6 MSCs: <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3440">MSC3440</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3816">MSC3816</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3856">MSC3856</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3715">MSC3715</a>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3771">MSC3771</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3773">MSC3773</a>. It‚Äôs been a lot of iteration on the reference implementations to get threads this far, and we‚Äôre excited to see how the client implementations evolve to provide more structured and less noisy communication for everyone - keep us updated with <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/category/this-week-in-matrix">TWIM</a> posts, please!
</p>
<p>
Threads have involved changes to event relationships (which were <a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/06/16/matrix-v-1-3-release#aggregations-and-the-relationships-made-along-the-way">fixed in v1.3</a>), read receipts, and notification counts, resulting in several different models and ways of solving the problem. We think we‚Äôve reached a point that works for conversational threads, though there‚Äôs work on the horizon for threads-only rooms, Twitter-style free-form threads, etc to cover more needs of users.
</p>
<p>
Currently, the demonstration implementation of threads in Synapse and Element is working its way out of the proof-of-concept and beta stages (which were sufficient to validate the MSCs) and are on their way to exiting beta. Keep an eye on the respective blogs for news about production-ready threads!
</p>
<h2>üìù Edits</h2>


<p>
Similar to reactions, err, <em><a href="https://matrix.org/blog/2022/06/16/matrix-v-1-3-release#aggregations-and-the-relationships-made-along-the-way">aggregations</a></em>, <a href="https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2676">MSC2676</a> and its predecessors have been around for a long while. Edits have existed in the Element clients seemingly forever, and other clients have had troubles trying to implement the same feature: with it now in the spec, it should be a lot easier to bring edits into clients.
</p>
<p>
For edits, we‚Äôve taken the route of making the MSC match reality, for better or worse. MSCs which improve or add functionality to the system are very much welcome - <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/proposals/">writing an MSC</a> is relatively easy and helps the whole community.
</p>
<h2>üë• Private read receipts</h2>


<p>
Not everyone wants to broadcast that they‚Äôve read a message, but also with read receipts tied into notifications those same people also probably don‚Äôt want stuck notifications. To address the problem, we‚Äôve added a new <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/v1.4/client-server-api/#private-read-receipts">m.read.private receipt type</a> which behaves exactly like m.read, but is only visible to you.
</p>
<p>
We still have a rework of the notifications system in our long-term plan, but this should hopefully cover the privacy concerns for the time being :)
</p>
<h2>The full changelog</h2>


<p>
MSCs are how the spec changes in the way it does - adding, fixing, and maintaining features for the whole ecosystem to use. The blog post can‚Äôt cover them all, but that doesn‚Äôt make them any less important! Check out the full changelog below, and the <a href="https://spec.matrix.org/proposals/">Spec Change Proposals</a> page for more information on how these MSCs got merged (hint: they submitted a proposal, which anyone can do - take a look at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFkZz60RRfc">Matrix Live episode</a> where Matthew covers the proposal process).
