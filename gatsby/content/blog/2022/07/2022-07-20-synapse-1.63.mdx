Hey all, it's time for another Synapse release! That's right, [Synapse
1.63](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.63.0) is out,
let's have a look at it.

## Clarifications on "anonymised" server statistics

Synapse has the ability to report usage statistics to the Matrix.org Foundation
(or to another location, if configured to do so). These statistics, such as
number of users, number of rooms joined by the server, etc. (they don't feature
any identifiable information about users and rooms) help us monitor the health
of the public federation.

In this release of Synapse, we have updated our public documentation about this
feature to clarify how it works and what exactly is being reported. This
documentation can be found [right
here](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.63/usage/administration/monitoring/reporting_homeserver_usage_statistics.html).

Note that previous documentation and prompts surrounding this feature called it
"anonymised" server statistics. This could easily be misinterpreted, as while
per-user statistics are not reported, homeserver server names are. We have
therefore changed said documentation and prompts to be clearer about
what is actually reported.

Note that your homeserver will never report any statistics if the `report_stats`
configuration option is set to `false`. Server admins who are curious about
which software is used by the Matrix.org Foundation to record server statistics
can check out [panopticon](https://github.com/matrix-org/panopticon).

## Improved filtering for public room search

This version of Synapse ships with an experimental implementation of
[MSC3827](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3827) which
allows filtering public room search results by room type. This feature will
enable better discoverability for Matrix Spaces (which are rooms with a specific
type, under the hood), as it will enable clients to search specifically for
public spaces.

This feature is still experimental as [its
MSC](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3827) hasn't
completed the MSC process yet, though it is in its final comment period at the
time this post is being written. This means a stable implementation will be
coming to Synapse very soon, so watch this space!

## Everything else

Synapse 1.63 also includes a new rate limiter to limit invites per issuer. This
rate limiter can be configured using the new `rc_invites.per_issuer`
configuration setting, see [the
documentation](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/latest/usage/configuration/config_documentation.html#rc_invites)
for more information.

See the [full
changelog](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.63.0) for a
complete list of changes in this release.

Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our
thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including (in no particular
order) [Beeper](https://www.beeper.com/),
[villepeh](https://github.com/villepeh) and [Petr
VanÄ›k](https://github.com/arkamar), as well as anyone helping us make Synapse
better by sharing their feedback and reporting issues.
