[Synapse 1.58](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.58.0) is
out! Let's dive into this new release.

# Poetry

If you've been reading the past few Synapse release announcements, you might
have already heard about our efforts to integrate
[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) into Synapse. Poetry is a tool which
manages dependencies of a Python project. Its killer feature is its lockfile,
which explicitly pins all dependencies (direct and transitive) to a fixed
version, even across multiple Python versions and platforms. See more about why
we choose Poetry [here](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/11537).

During the past few months, we've been hard at work converting Synapse and its
CI to use Poetry. The goal is to make our Docker images and Debian packages more
reproducible and to provide a fixed, known-good environment for CI. This will
help us to ensure the stability and security of Synapse installations.

Synapse 1.57's Docker image was the first to use Poetry; after a successful
trial, this was extended to Synapse 1.58's Debian packages. Installations from
PyPI using `pip` will _not_ use the locked environment, though everyone is
welcome to install from source using [our
lockfile](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/develop/poetry.lock).

Huge props to [David](https://github.com/DMRobertson) from the Synapse team for
leading the work on this front.

## Everything else

This release of Synapse also includes performance improvements around sharing
device list updates, which should greatly improve login times for large Matrix
accounts.

Synapse 1.58 also includes the implementation of two MSCs:
[MSC3383](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/3383) to
include destination in federation authentication headers, and
[MSC2815](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/2815) which
(if enabled) allows room moderators to see the content of a redacted event (as
long as it hasn't already been deleted by the homeserver).

See the [full
changelog](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v1.58.0) for a
complete list of changes in this release. Also please have a look at the
[upgrade
notes](https://matrix-org.github.io/synapse/v1.58/upgrade#upgrading-to-v1580)
for this version.

Synapse is a Free and Open Source Software project, and we'd like to extend our
thanks to everyone who contributed to this release, including (in no particular
order) [Beeper](https://www.beeper.com/), [Dirk
Klimpel](https://github.com/dklimpel), [Famedly](https://famedly.com/) and
[Sami Olmari](https://github.com/olmari).
