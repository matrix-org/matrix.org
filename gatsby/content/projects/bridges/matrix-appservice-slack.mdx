This project bridges [Slack](https://slack.com) to Matrix.

The bridge allows you to connect Matrix rooms and Slack channels together. It supports bridging via webhooks or via a
dedicated slack integration (using the Events API). The bridge supports nearly all matrix message types and client features
with active development on new features as they arrive. Check the list below for feature support.

The bridge is regularly hacked on and is accepting new PRs for bugfixes and features, come and get involved!

✓ Direct (1:1) Chats  
✓ Group (‘Channel’) Chats  
✗ History  
✓ Typing notifications and read receipts  
✓ Text Messages  
✓ Reactions  
✓ Redactions/Deleting Events  
✓ Threading/Replies  
✓ Formatted Text Content  
✓ Media Content  

When using [Element on app.element.io](https://app.element.io), you can enable Slack integration per-room. Click the “Manage Integrations” (four squares) button at the top of the page.
