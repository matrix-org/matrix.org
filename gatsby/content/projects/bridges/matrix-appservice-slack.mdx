This project bridges [Slack](https://slack.com) to Matrix.

The bridge allows you to connect Matrix rooms and Slack channels together. It supports bridging via webhooks or via a
dedicated slack integration (using the Events API). The bridge supports nearly all matrix message types and client features
with active development on new features as they arrive. Check the list below for feature support.

The bridge is regularly hacked on and is accepting new PRs for bugfixes and features, come and get involved!

✓ Direct (1:1) Chats  
✓ Group (‘Channel’) Chats  
✗ History  
✓ Typing notifications and read receipts  
✓ Text Messages  
✓ Reactions  
✓ Redactions/Deleting Events  
✓ Threading/Replies  
✓ Formatted Text Content  
✓ Media Content  

When using [Element](https://element.io) with the default integrations manager (`scalar.vector.im`), you can enable the Slack integration per-room. Click the "Room info" button in the top right corner of the page and then click "Add widgets, bridges & bots".

Get it from [GitHub](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack)!
