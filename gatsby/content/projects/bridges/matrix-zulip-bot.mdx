Exchange messages between matrix.org and Zulip! Messages are bridged
via a bot user on both Zulip and matrix. [The
project](https://github.com/zulip/python-zulip-api/tree/master/zulip/integrations/bridge_with_matrix)
uses the
[matrix-python-sdk](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk)
for interacting with matrix.
