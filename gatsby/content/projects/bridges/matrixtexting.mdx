This is an Android App that will bridge SMS/MMS messages between your cellphone and a matrix server.
The app will watch for incoming messages and forward them to a matrix room based on the cellphone
number. If there is no existing room the app will create a new room and invite the user to a
conversation. You may also create a room, invite the bot, and set the topic to the cellphone number
to start a new conversation.
