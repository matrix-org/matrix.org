Prosody module to act as a Matrix Application Service.  This module allows XMPP
users to join Matrix rooms as if they were MUC rooms, unlike most Matrix
bridges that allow Matrix users to join rooms from other networks.  I did this
direction since it seemed easier, and I was mostly interested in seeing how
well the idea worked.
