You can self host [matrix-bifrost](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-bifrost) in order to bridge your rooms
with XMPP, it is also available from [aria-net.org](https://aria-net.org/SitePages/Portal/Bridges.aspx) and [matrix.org](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-bifrost/wiki/Address-syntax).

This bridge is in very active development currently and intended mainly for experimentation and evaluation purposes.
