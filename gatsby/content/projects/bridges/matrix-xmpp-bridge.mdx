This project creates a bridge between a Matrix room and an XMPP MUC. It is currently very early in development and only relays messages one way (from XMPP to Matrix). Use it if you wish, but don't blame me if it blows up in your face.

This is a more updated fork of [https://github.com/jfrederickson/matrix-xmpp-bridge](https://github.com/jfrederickson/matrix-xmpp-bridge)
