[Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/) is a free, open-source email, calendar, and chat application which runs on multiple platforms. It supports multiple instant messaging protocols, including IRC, XMPP, and Matrix.

Thunderbird is [available for download](https://www.thunderbird.net/) and the [source code is available](https://hg.mozilla.org/comm-central). Additionally there is [documentation for getting started with contributing](https://developer.thunderbird.net/). Please [file any bugs found](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Chat+Core&component=Matrix).

Matrix support in Thunderbird is enabled by default in Daily builds (as of Thunderbird 91), but can be enabled in beta and release builds by setting `chat.prpls.prpl-matrix.disable` to `false` in the advanced config editor (>Tools >Options >Advanced >Config Editor).
