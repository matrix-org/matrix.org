coap-proxy is a **proof of concept experiment** for converting normal Matrix HTTPS+JSON
traffic into an ultra-low-bandwidth CoAP+CBOR+Flate+Noise+UDP network transport.
The resulting transport typically uses 35x-70x less bandwidth than HTTPS+JSON, and
attempts to fit typical Matrix transactions into a single roundtrip on a 100bps network link.

coap-proxy depends heavily on our experimental fork of [go-ocf/go-coap](https://github.com/matrix-org/go-coap),
which implements Noise-based encryption, compression hooks and retry semantics.

More details on the transport can be found in our
"Breaking the 100 bits per second barrier with Matrix" FOSDEM 2019 talk:
https://matrix.org/blog/2019/03/12/breaking-the-100bps-barrier-with-matrix-meshsim-coap-proxy/

The typical way to run coap-proxy is via docker using the [meshsim](https://github.com/matrix-org/meshsim)
network simulator, which fires up docker containers in a simulated bad network environment
containing both synapse and coap-proxy configured such that coap-proxy intercepts both client-server and
server-server traffic.
