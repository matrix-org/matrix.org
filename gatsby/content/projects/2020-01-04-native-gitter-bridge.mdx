This project bridges [Gitter](https://gitter.im) to Matrix and is already hosted for you. It creates portal rooms for every public room on Gitter which you can join via `#org_repo:gitter.im` (just replace the `/` in the Gitter URI with an underscore `_`). For example https://gitter.im/nodejs/node corresponds to [#nodejs_node:gitter.im](https://matrix.to/#/#nodejs_node:gitter.im).

If you're already using [Element](https://element.io), you can browse all of the Gitter rooms in the public room directory (switch to the `gitter.im` server).
