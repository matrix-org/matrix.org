Terraform is a tool to interact with your infrastructure as code. In some cases, a matrix homeserver is considered a critical part of your infrastructure. This provider gives operators the ability to interact with their homeservers, managing users, media, rooms, and more as Terraform resources.

The source, and more information, can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/turt2live/terraform-provider-matrix).
