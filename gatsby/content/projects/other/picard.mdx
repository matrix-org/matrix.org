This opsdroid skill enables the bridging of a slack team to a matrix communtiy. It uses the
[slack appservice](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack) to
bridge individual rooms, but it monitors slack for new channels and creates
rooms on matrix for these new channels and then configures the appservice to
bridge them. It also will add these rooms to a matrix communtiy.

Why is this called Picard? He commands the bridge!
