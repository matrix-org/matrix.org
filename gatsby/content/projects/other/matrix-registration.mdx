A simple Python application to have a token based Matrix registration.  

If you're like me and encountered the situation where you want to invite your friends to your homeserver, 
but neither wanted to open up public registration nor create accounts for every individual user yourself, this project should be the solution.

With this project you can just quickly generate tokens on the fly and share them with your friends to allow them to register to your homeserver.
