An implementation of the Double Ratchet cryptographic ratchet described by <https://whispersystems.org/docs/specifications/doubleratchet/>, written in C and C++11 and exposed as a C API.

The specification of the Olm ratchet can be found at <https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm/-/blob/master/docs/olm.md>.

This library also includes an implementation of the Megolm cryptographic
ratchet, as specified at <https://gitlab.matrix.org/matrix-org/olm/-/blob/master/docs/megolm.md>.
