The Server_Stats Project consists of 3 parts:

1. It has a tool to read which servers are considered active by synapse and extracts their versions via the federation API and exports those to a 
[Grafana Dashboard](https://grafana.nordgedanken.dev/d/HDVgeCXGk/matrix-server-stats?from=now-24h&to=now&orgId=1&refresh=10s)
2. It is a voyager bot. This means it follows aliases and room ids in every room it is in, joins that mentioned room, starts to look in older messages for 
potential aliases and joins them and so on. It also listens for new mentions after joining. Effectively gathering a view on the Matrix network.
3. It is a webpage to display the gathered data. You can find that webpage at https://serverstats.nordgedanken.dev and it contains various ways to display the gathered data.
