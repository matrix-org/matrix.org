Python bindings for Olm.

This is a fork of the official [python bindings][2] for the Olm C library found [here][1].
The bindings were rewritten using [CFFI for python][3].

The specification of the Olm cryptographic ratchet which is used for peer to
peer sessions of this library can be found [here][4].

The specification of the Megolm cryptographic ratchet which is used for group
sessions of this library can be found [here][5].

An example of the implementation of the Olm and Megolm cryptographic protocol
can be found in the Matrix protocol for which the implementation guide can be
found [here][6].

The full API reference can be found [here][7].
