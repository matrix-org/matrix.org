matrix-faq is a bot that allows for predefined messages to be sent with shorter, command-like aliases.

For example, you could run the following command in a Matrix room:

```sh
!faq projects
```

Which could then return the following text:
```
Projects I'm currently working on:

- Foo (github.com/user/foo)
- Bar (github.com/user/bar)
```
