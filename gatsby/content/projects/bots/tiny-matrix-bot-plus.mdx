tiny-matrix-bot plus

This is a simple Matrix bot based on matrix-python-sdk with no support and no warranty. It was forked from 4nd3r/tiny-matrix-bot.
It is no longer maintained as it has been replaced with https://github.com/8go/matrix-eno-bot. 
So, have a look at https://github.com/8go/matrix-eno-bot for a more advanced bot.

"tiny-matrix-bot plus" is still useful as an easy introduction into the world of bots. 
It is very easy to understand, very little code, and easy to set up and extend to your personal needs. 
It is meant for small private Matrix homeservers that are run by individuals for their friends. 
It is not performant and hence not suitable for industrial size roll-out. 
The bot itself is just a single Python file. Bot commands are implemented as Bash scripts or Python programs. 
It is a good tool to learn about bots and to change it to adapt it to your personal needs.
