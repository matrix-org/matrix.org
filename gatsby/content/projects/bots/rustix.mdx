A graph-based Matrix bot where the services are nodes. Events get passed
through the graph and modified or filtered as they move along.

Has built-in commands and services for tracking karma e.g. rust++ or cabbage--
and even (star trek)++, adding and retrieving quotes from a database or
csv file (retrieve only), playing roulette (getting kicked, or risky-roulette...
getting banned, assuming the bot has a high enough power level), and checking
crypto-currency prices by ticker symbol.

Instructions and files are provided for building and running rustix in docker
containers.
