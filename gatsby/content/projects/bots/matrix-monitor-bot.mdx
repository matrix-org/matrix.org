This bot monitors the latency between homeservers by sending messages into a dedicated room. Bots running on other homeservers watch for these messages and reply with timing information. Together, all the bots in the room form a latency map of message delivery times. Combined with the Prometheus metrics and built-in status page, this bot is very useful for both operators and end-users.
