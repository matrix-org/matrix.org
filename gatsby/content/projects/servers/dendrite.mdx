Dendrite is a second-generation Matrix homeserver written in Go. It intends to provide an efficient, reliable and scalable alternative to Synapse:

* **Efficient:** A small memory footprint with better baseline performance than an out-of-the-box Synapse.
* **Reliable:** Implements the Matrix specification as written, using the same test suite as Synapse as well as a brand new Go test suite.
* **Scalable:** Runs at any scale, from single-user single-process monolith deployments up to massive multi-process (or even multi-machine) polylith deployments.
