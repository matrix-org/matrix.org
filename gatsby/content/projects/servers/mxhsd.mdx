mxhsd wants to provide a Matrix Homeserver implementation with the expected level of admin, control and auditing corporations would expect, where every action performed by a user can be controlled by an ACL.

mxhsd wants to be as extensible as possible, relying on a module framework, so anyone can manage every detail of its server(s).
