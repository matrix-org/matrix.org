An IRCd implementation backed by Matrix. Inspired by [PTO](./pto.html)!

This is a work in progress. Matrix IRCd should be stable enough to hack on and test, but has not been tested in production or for any length of time.

See the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ircd/issues) for a more detailed breakdown of what is left to do, and/or join the discussion on the Matrix channel: [#matrix-ircd:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-ircd:matrix.org)

You can check out the code from [GitHub](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ircd).
