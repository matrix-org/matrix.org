The current focus is on creating a simple and stable chat application
which runs on all platforms. The Quadrix apps are available on Linux
(snap and flatpak packages for amd64, arm64, armhf), Windows, Mac,
Android and iOS. It has been tested on a PinePhone running Mobian/Phosh.
There is no VoIP support yet, but Quadrix does offer in-app
videoconferencing with Jitsi Meet. Please visit the Github repo for
more information. Feel free to open an issue on Github, or leave a
