# matrix-commander-rs

simple but convenient CLI-based Matrix client app for sending and receiving

# Help create this Rust program!

Currently you can log in, verify your account, send unencrypted messages, send 
encypted messages, send encrypted files, list devices, and log out. 
We should be able to do more!

This project is currently only a vision. The Python package matrix-commander
exists. See [matrix-commander](https://github.com/8go/matrix-commander/).
The vision is to have a compatible program in Rust. I cannot do it myself,
but I can coordinate and merge your pull requests.
This project depends on you. The project will only advance if you provide
the code. Have a look at the repo
[matrix-commander-rs](https://github.com/8go/matrix-commander-rs/).
Please help! Please contribute code to make this vision a reality,
and to one day have a functional
[matrix-commander](https://crates.io/crates/matrix-commander) crate.
Safe!
