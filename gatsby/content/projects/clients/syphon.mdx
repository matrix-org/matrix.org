Syphon aims to be built on the foundations of privacy, branding, and user experience in an effort to pull others away from proprietary chat clients to the matrix protocol. See [syphon.org/about](https://www.syphon.org/about).

Syphon is currently in Open Alpha, meaning that anyone can install and use it, but it is not recommended for day-to-day use.

The app can be downloaded from [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.tether.tether), [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/syphon/id1496285352) or [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.tether.tether) while the source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/syphon-org/syphon).

Contributions are also very welcome, be it in the form of code, bug reports or translations.
