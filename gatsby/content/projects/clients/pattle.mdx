Pattle is an easy to use Android app for Matrix, with
design inspired by other popular IM apps.

The goal of Pattle is to create an app that behaves similiary
(and almost exactly) like many modern popular chat apps of today,
like WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal. This is not the only goal,
however: the primary goal of Pattle is to be a Matrix app that
everyone can use, in terms of simplicity.
