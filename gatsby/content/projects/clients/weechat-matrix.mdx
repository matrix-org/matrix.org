[WeeChat](https://weechat.org/) is a super powerful CLI chat client that is extensible in many languages to allow for new protocols like Matrix.

Weechat-Matrix is a Python plugin for Weechat that lets Weechat communicate over the Matrix protocol.

This script supports large parts of the Matrix protocol, end to end encryption support is still experimental.

See <https://github.com/poljar/weechat-matrix> for installation details.
