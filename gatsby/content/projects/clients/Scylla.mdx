Scylla is a minimalist Elm-based web client for Matrix. You can try it out on [https://scylla.danilafe.com](https://scylla.danilafe.com)

### Why?

Riot, the flagship Matrix client, is slow. Switching rooms has a noticeable delay (probably around several hundred milliseconds). History loading causes strange jumps in the scroll position. Scylla aims to be faster and more responsive, while still maintaining all the necessary features for a chat client.
