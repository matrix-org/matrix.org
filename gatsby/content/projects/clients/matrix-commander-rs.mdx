# matrix-commander-rs

simple but convenient CLI-based Matrix client app for sending and receiving

# Help create this Rust program!

Currently you can log in, verify your device, send encrypted or unencrypted
messages, send encrypted or unencrypted files of various Mime types, 
list devices, and log out. We should be able to do more!

This project is currently only a vision. The Python package matrix-commander
exists. See [matrix-commander](https://github.com/8go/matrix-commander/).
The vision is to have a compatible program in Rust. I cannot do it myself,
but I can coordinate and merge your pull requests.
This project depends on you. The project will only advance if you provide
the code. Have a look at the repo
[matrix-commander-rs](https://github.com/8go/matrix-commander-rs/).
Please help! Please contribute code to make this vision a reality,
and to one day have a functional
[matrix-commander](https://crates.io/crates/matrix-commander) crate.
Safe!
