# matrix-commander

Simple but convenient CLI-based Matrix client app for sending, receiving,
creating rooms, inviting, verifying, and so much more.

- `matrix-commander` is a simple command-line [Matrix](https://matrix.org/)
  client.
- It is a simple but convenient app to
    - send Matrix text messages as well as text, image, audio, video or
      other arbitrary files
    - listen to and receive Matrix messages, images, audio, video, etc.
    - download media files like images or audio
    - perform Matrix emoji verification
    - performs actions of rooms (create rooms, invite to rooms, etc.)
    - and much more
- It exclusively offers a command-line interface (CLI).
- Hence the word-play: matrix-command(lin)er
- There is no GUI and there are no windows (except for pop-up windows in
  OS notification)
- It uses the [matrix-nio](https://github.com/poljar/matrix-nio/) SDK
- Both `matrix-nio` and `matrix-commander` are written in Python 3

## Summary

This program is a simple but convenient app to send and receive Matrix
messages from the CLI in various different ways.

Use cases for this program could be
- a bot or part of a bot,
- to send alerts,
- combine it with cron to publish periodic data,
- send yourself daily/weekly reminders via a cron job
- send yourself a daily song from your music collection
- a trivial way to fire off some instant messages from the command line
- to automate sending via programs and scripts
- a "blogger" who frequently sends messages and images to the same
  room(s) could use it
- a person could write a diary or run a gratitude journal by
  sending messages to her/his own room
- as educational material that showcases the use of the `matrix-nio` SDK

## End-to-end Encryption

End-to-end encryption (e2ee) is enabled by default. It cannot be turned off.
Wherever possible end-to-end encryption will be used. 

## Sending

Messages to send can be provided
1) in the command line (-m or --message)
2) as input from the keyboard
3) through a pipe from stdin (|), i.e. piped in from another program.

For sending messages the program supports various text formats:
1) text: default
2) html:  HTML formatted text
3) markdown: MarkDown formatted text
4) code: used a block of fixed-sized font, ideal for ASCII art or
   tables, bash outputs, etc.
5) notification
6) split: splits messages into multiple units at given pattern

Photos and images that can be sent. That includes files like
.jpg, .gif, .png or .svg.

Arbitrary files like .txt, .pdf, .doc, audio files like .mp3
or video files like .mp4 can also be sent.

Matrix events like sending an emoji reaction, replying as a thread,
message edits can be sent.

## Listening, Receiving

One can listen to one or multiple rooms. Received messages will be displayed
on the screen. If desired, optionally, you can be notified of incoming
messages through the operating system standard notification system, usually a
small pop-up window.

Messages can be received or listened to various ways:
1) Forever: the program runs forever, listens forever, and prints all
   messages as they arrive in real-time.
2) Once: the program prints all the messages that are waiting in the queue,
   i.e. all messages that have been sent in, and after printing them the
   program terminates.
3) Tail: prints the last N read or unread messages of one or multiple
   specified rooms and after printing them the program terminates.

When listening to messages you can also choose to download and decrypt
media. Say, someone is sending a song. The mp3 file can be downloaded
and automatically decrypted for you.

## Verification

The program can accept verification request and verify other devices
via emojis. Do do so use the --verify option and the program will
await incoming verification request and act accordingly.

## Room Operations, Actions on Rooms

The program can create rooms, join, leave and forget rooms.
It can also send invitations to join rooms to
others (given that user has the appropriate permissions) as
well as ban, unban and kick other users from rooms.

## Examples of calling `matrix-commander`

```
$ matrix-commander.py # first run; this will configure everything
$ matrix-commander.py --no-sso # alternative first run without Single Sign-On;
$   # this will configure everything on a headless server w/o a browser
$ # this created a credentials.json file, and a store directory.
$ # optionally, if you want you can move credentials to app config directory
$ mkdir $HOME/.config/matrix-commander # optional
$ mv -i credentials.json $HOME/.config/matrix-commander/
$ # optionally, if you want you can move store to the app share directory
$ mkdir $HOME/.local/share/matrix-commander # optional
$ mv -i store $HOME/.local/share/matrix-commander/
$ # Now you are ready to run program for a second time
$ # Let us verify the device/room to where we want to send messages
$ # The other device will issue a "verify by emoji" request

Welcome to matrix-commander, a Matrix CLI client. ─── On first run this
program will configure itself. On further runs this program implements a
simple Matrix CLI client that can send messages, listen to messages, verify
devices, etc. It can send one or multiple message to one or multiple Matrix
rooms. The text messages can be of various formats such as "text", "html",
"markdown" or "code". Images, audio or arbitrary files can be sent as well.
For receiving there are three main options: listen forever, listen once and
quit, and get the last N messages and quit. Emoji verification is built-in
which can be used to verify devices. End-to-end encryption is enabled by
default and cannot be turned off. ─── See dependencies in source code or in
README.md on Github. For even more explications and examples also read the
documentation provided in the top portion of the source code and in the Github
README.md file.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d, --debug           Print debug information. If used once, only the log
                        level of matrix-commander is set to DEBUG. If used
                        twice ("-d -d" or "-dd") then log levels of both
                        matrix-commander and underlying modules are set to
                        DEBUG. "-d" is a shortcut for "--log-level DEBUG". See
                        also --log-level. "-d" takes precedence over "--log-
                        level".
  --log-level LOG_LEVEL [LOG_LEVEL ...]
                        Set the log level(s). Possible values are "DEBUG",
                        "INFO", "WARNING", "ERROR", and "CRITICAL". If
                        --log_level is used with one level argument, only the
                        log level of matrix-commander is set to the specified
                        value. If --log_level is used with two level argument
                        (e.g. "--log-level WARNING ERROR") then log levels of
                        both matrix-commander and underlying modules are set
                        to the specified values. See also --debug.
  -c CREDENTIALS, --credentials CREDENTIALS
                        On first run, information about homeserver, user, room
                        id, etc. will be written to a credentials file. By
                        default, this file is "credentials.json". On further
                        runs the credentials file is read to permit logging
                        into the correct Matrix account and sending messages
                        to the preconfigured room. If this option is provided,
                        the provided file name will be used as credentials
                        file instead of the default one.
  -r ROOM [ROOM ...], --room ROOM [ROOM ...]
                        Send to this room or these rooms. None, one or
                        multiple rooms can be specified. The default room is
                        provided in credentials file. If a room (or multiple
                        ones) is (or are) provided in the arguments, then it
                        (or they) will be used instead of the one from the
                        credentials file. The user must have access to the
                        specified room in order to send messages there.
                        Messages cannot be sent to arbitrary rooms. When
                        specifying the room id some shells require the
                        exclamation mark to be escaped with a backslash.
  --room-create ROOM_CREATE [ROOM_CREATE ...]
                        Create this room or these rooms. One or multiple room
                        aliases can be specified. The room (or multiple ones)
                        provided in the arguments will be created. The user
                        must be permitted to create rooms.Combine --room-
                        create with --name and --topic to add names and topics
                        to the room(s) to be created.
  --room-join ROOM_JOIN [ROOM_JOIN ...]
                        Join this room or these rooms. One or multiple room
                        aliases can be specified. The room (or multiple ones)
                        provided in the arguments will be joined. The user
                        must have permissions to join these rooms.
  --room-leave ROOM_LEAVE [ROOM_LEAVE ...]
                        Leave this room or these rooms. One or multiple room
                        aliases can be specified. The room (or multiple ones)
                        provided in the arguments will be left.
  --room-forget ROOM_FORGET [ROOM_FORGET ...]
                        After leaving a room you should (most likely) forget
                        the room. Forgetting a room removes the users' room
                        history. One or multiple room aliases can be
                        specified. The room (or multiple ones) provided in the
                        arguments will be forgotten. If all users forget a
                        room, the room can eventually be deleted on the
                        server.
  --room-invite ROOM_INVITE [ROOM_INVITE ...]
                        Invite one ore more users to join one or more rooms.
                        Specify the user(s) as arguments to --user. Specify
                        the rooms as arguments to this option, i.e. as
                        arguments to --room-invite. The user must have
                        permissions to invite users.
  --room-ban ROOM_BAN [ROOM_BAN ...]
                        Ban one ore more users from one or more rooms. Specify
                        the user(s) as arguments to --user. Specify the rooms
                        as arguments to this option, i.e. as arguments to
                        --room-ban. The user must have permissions to ban
                        users.
  --room-unban ROOM_UNBAN [ROOM_UNBAN ...]
                        Unban one ore more users from one or more rooms.
                        Specify the user(s) as arguments to --user. Specify
                        the rooms as arguments to this option, i.e. as
                        arguments to --room-unban. The user must have
                        permissions to unban users.
  --room-kick ROOM_KICK [ROOM_KICK ...]
                        Kick one ore more users from one or more rooms.
                        Specify the user(s) as arguments to --user. Specify
                        the rooms as arguments to this option, i.e. as
                        arguments to --room-kick. The user must have
                        permissions to kick users.
  --user USER [USER ...]
                        Specify one or multiple users. This option is only
                        meaningful in combination with options like --room-
                        invite, --room-ban, --room-unban, --room-kick. This
                        option --user specifies the users to be used with
                        these other room commands (like invite, ban, etc.)
  --name NAME [NAME ...]
                        Specify one or multiple names. This option is only
                        meaningful in combination with option --room-create.
                        This option --name specifies the names to be used with
                        the command --room-create.
  --topic TOPIC [TOPIC ...]
                        Specify one or multiple topics. This option is only
                        meaningful in combination with option --room-create.
                        This option --topic specifies the topics to be used
                        with the command --room-create.
  -m MESSAGE [MESSAGE ...], --message MESSAGE [MESSAGE ...]
                        Send this message. If not specified, and no input
                        piped in from stdin, then message will be read from
                        stdin, i.e. keyboard. This option can be used multiple
                        times to send multiple messages. If there is data
                        piped into this program, then first data from the pipe
                        is published, then messages from this option are
                        published. Messages will be sent last, i.e. after
                        objects like images, audio, files, etc. To force that
                        no message is sent, use "-m ''". Input piped via stdin
                        can additionally be specified with the special
                        character '-'. If you want to feed a text message into
                        matrix-commander via a pipe, via stdin, then specify
                        the special character '-'. If '-' is specified as
                        message, then the program will read the message from
                        stdin. If your message is literally '-' then use '\-'
                        as message in the argument. '-' may appear in any
                        position, i.e. '-m "start" - "end"' will send 3
                        messages out of which the second one is read from
                        stdin. '-' may appear only once overall in all
                        arguments.
  -i IMAGE [IMAGE ...], --image IMAGE [IMAGE ...]
                        Send this image. This option can be used multiple
                        times to send multiple images. First images are sent,
                        then text messages are sent. If you want to feed an
                        image into matrix-commander via a pipe, via stdin,
                        then specify the special character '-'. If '-' is
                        specified as image file name, then the program will
                        read the image data from stdin. If your image file is
                        literally named '-' then use '\-' as filename in the
                        argument. '-' may appear in any position, i.e. '-i
                        image1.jpg - image3.png' will send 3 images out of
                        which the second one is read from stdin. '-' may
                        appear only once overall in all arguments. If the file
                        exists already, it is more efficient to specify the
                        file name than to pipe the file through stdin.
  -a AUDIO [AUDIO ...], --audio AUDIO [AUDIO ...]
                        Send this audio file. This option can be used multiple
                        times to send multiple audio files. First audios are
                        sent, then text messages are sent. If you want to feed
                        an audio into matrix-commander via a pipe, via stdin,
                        then specify the special character '-'. See
                        description of '-i' to see how '-' is handled.
  -f FILE [FILE ...], --file FILE [FILE ...]
                        Send this file (e.g. PDF, DOC, MP4). This option can
                        be used multiple times to send multiple files. First
                        files are sent, then text messages are sent. If you
                        want to feed a file into matrix-commander via a pipe,
                        via stdin, then specify the special character '-'. See
                        description of '-i' to see how '-' is handled.
  -e EVENT [EVENT ...], --event EVENT [EVENT ...]
                        Send an event that is formatted as a JSON object as
                        specified by the Matrix protocol. This allows the
                        advanced user to send additional types of events such
                        as reactions, send replies to previous events, or edit
                        previous messages. Specifications for events can be
                        found at https://spec.matrix.org/unstable/proposals/.
                        This option can be used multiple times to send
                        multiple events. First events are sent, then text
                        messages are sent. If you want to feed an event into
                        matrix-commander via a pipe, via stdin, then specify
                        the special character '-'. See description of '-i' to
                        see how '-' is handled.
  -w, --html            Send message as format "HTML". If not specified,
                        message will be sent as format "TEXT". E.g. that
                        allows some text to be bold, etc. Only a subset of
                        HTML tags are accepted by Matrix.
  -z, --markdown        Send message as format "MARKDOWN". If not specified,
                        message will be sent as format "TEXT". E.g. that
                        allows sending of text formatted in MarkDown language.
  -k, --code            Send message as format "CODE". If not specified,
                        message will be sent as format "TEXT". If both --html
                        and --code are specified then --code takes priority.
                        This is useful for sending ASCII-art or tabbed output
                        like tables as a fixed-sized font will be used for
                        display.
  -p SPLIT, --split SPLIT
                        If set, split the message(s) into multiple messages
                        wherever the string specified with --split occurs.
                        E.g. One pipes a stream of RSS articles into the
                        program and the articles are separated by three
                        newlines. Then with --split set to "\n\n\n" each
                        article will be printed in a separate message. By
                        default, i.e. if not set, no messages will be split.
  -j CONFIG, --config CONFIG
                        Location of a config file. By default, no config file
                        is used. If this option is provided, the provided file
                        name will be used to read configuration from.
  --proxy PROXY         Optionally specify a proxy for connectivity. By
                        default, i.e. if this option is not set, no proxy is
                        used. If this option is used a proxy URL must be
                        provided. The provided proxy URL will be used for the
                        HTTP connection to the server. The proxy supports
                        SOCKS4(a), SOCKS5, and HTTP (tunneling). Examples of
                        valid URLs are "http://10.10.10.10:8118" or
                        "socks5://user:password@127.0.0.1:1080". URLs with
                        "https" or "socks4a" are not valid. Only "http",
                        "socks4" and "socks5" are valid.
  -n, --notice          Send message as notice. If not specified, message will
                        be sent as text.
  --encrypted           Send message end-to-end encrypted. Encryption is
                        always turned on and will always be used where
                        possible. It cannot be turned off. This flag does
                        nothing as encryption is turned on with or without
                        this argument.
  -s STORE, --store STORE
                        Path to directory to be used as "store" for encrypted
                        messaging. By default, this directory is "./store/".
                        Since encryption is always enabled, a store is always
                        needed. If this option is provided, the provided
                        directory name will be used as persistent storage
                        directory instead of the default one. Preferably, for
                        multiple executions of this program use the same store
                        for the same device. The store directory can be shared
                        between multiple different devices and users.
  -l [LISTEN], --listen [LISTEN]
                        The --listen option takes one argument. There are
                        several choices: "never", "once", "forever", "tail",
                        and "all". By default, --listen is set to "never". So,
                        by default no listening will be done. Set it to
                        "forever" to listen for and print incoming messages to
                        stdout. "--listen forever" will listen to all messages
                        on all rooms forever. To stop listening "forever", use
                        Control-C on the keyboard or send a signal to the
                        process or service. The PID for signaling can be found
                        in a PID file in directory "/home/user/.run". "--
                        listen once" will get all the messages from all rooms
                        that are currently queued up. So, with "once" the
                        program will start, print waiting messages (if any)
                        and then stop. The timeout for "once" is set to 10
                        seconds. So, be patient, it might take up to that
                        amount of time. "tail" reads and prints the last N
                        messages from the specified rooms, then quits. The
                        number N can be set with the --tail option. With
                        "tail" some messages read might be old, i.e. already
                        read before, some might be new, i.e. never read
                        before. It prints the messages and then the program
                        stops. Messages are sorted, last-first. Look at --tail
                        as that option is related to --listen tail. The option
                        "all" gets all messages available, old and new. Unlike
                        "once" and "forever" that listen in ALL rooms, "tail"
                        and "all" listen only to the room specified in the
                        credentials file or the --room options. Furthermore,
                        when listening to messages, no messages will be sent.
                        Hence, when listening, --message must not be used and
                        piped input will be ignored.
  -t [TAIL], --tail [TAIL]
                        The --tail option reads and prints up to the last N
                        messages from the specified rooms, then quits. It
                        takes one argument, an integer, which we call N here.
                        If there are fewer than N messages in a room, it reads
                        and prints up to N messages. It gets the last N
                        messages in reverse order. It print the newest message
                        first, and the oldest message last. If --listen-self
                        is not set it will print less than N messages in many
                        cases because N messages are obtained, but some of
                        them are discarded by default if they are from the
                        user itself. Look at --listen as this option is
                        related to --tail.Furthermore, when tailing messages,
                        no messages will be sent. Hence, when tailing or
                        listening, --message must not be used and piped input
                        will be ignored.
  -y, --listen-self     If set and listening, then program will listen to and
                        print also the messages sent by its own user. By
                        default messages from oneself are not printed.
  --print-event-id      If set and listening, then program will print also the
                        event id foreach message or other event.
  -u [DOWNLOAD_MEDIA], --download-media [DOWNLOAD_MEDIA]
                        If set and listening, then program will download
                        received media files (e.g. image, audio, video, text,
                        PDF files). media will be downloaded to local
                        directory. By default, media will be downloaded to is
                        "./media/". You can overwrite default with your
                        preferred directory. If media is encrypted it will be
                        decrypted and stored decrypted. By default media files
                        will not be downloaded.
  -o, --os-notify       If set and listening, then program will attempt to
                        visually notify of arriving messages through the
                        operating system. By default there is no notification
                        via OS.
  -v [VERIFY], --verify [VERIFY]
                        Perform verification. By default, no verification is
                        performed. Possible values are: "emoji". If
                        verification is desired, run this program in the
                        foreground (not as a service) and without a pipe.
                        Verification questions will be printed on stdout and
                        the user has to respond via the keyboard to accept or
                        reject verification. Once verification is complete,
                        stop the program and run it as a service again. Don't
                        send messages or files when you verify.
  -x RENAME_DEVICE, --rename-device RENAME_DEVICE
                        Rename the current device to the new device name
                        provided. No other operations like sending, listening,
                        or verifying are allowed when renaming the device.
  --display-name DISPLAY_NAME
                        Set the display name for the current user to the value
                        provided. No other operations like sending, listening,
                        or verifying are allowed when setting the display
                        name.
  --no-ssl              Skip SSL verification. By default (if this option is
                        not used) the SSL certificate is validated for the
                        connection. But, if this option is used, then the SSL
                        certificate validation will be skipped. This is useful
                        for home-servers that have no SSL certificate. If used
                        together with the "--ssl-certificate" parameter, this
                        option is meaningless and an error will be raised.
  --ssl-certificate SSL_CERTIFICATE
                        Use this option to use your own local SSL certificate
                        file. This is an optional parameter. This is useful
                        for home servers that have their own SSL certificate.
                        This allows you to use HTTPS/TLS for the connection
                        while using your own local SSL certificate. Specify
                        the path and file to your SSL certificate. If used
                        together with the "--no-ssl" parameter, this option is
                        meaningless and an error will be raised.
  --no-sso              This argument is optional. If it is not used, the
                        default login method will be used. This default login
                        method is: SSO (Single Sign-On). SSO starts a web
                        browser and connects the user to a webpage on the
                        server for login. SSO will only work if the server
                        supports it and if there is access to a browser. If
                        this argument is used, then SSO will be avoided. This
                        is useful on headless homeservers where there is no
                        browser installed or accessible. It is also useful if
                        the user prefers to login via a password. So, if SSO
                        should be avoided and a password login is preferred
                        then set this option. This option is only meaningful
                        on the first run that initializes matrix-commander.
                        Once credentials are established this option is
                        irrelevant and it will simply be ignored.
  --version             Print version information. After printing version
                        information program will continue to run. This is
                        useful for having version number in the log files.
