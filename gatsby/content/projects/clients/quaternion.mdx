Quaternion is a cross-platform Qt5-based desktop IM client for Matrix, a reference desktop application using [Quotient](/docs/projects/sdk/quotient). Source code, issue tracker, roadmap etc. can be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/quotient-im/Quaternion). Releases (with links to cross-platform source code archives, as well as binaries for Windows and macOS) are published at the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/quotient-im/Quaternion/releases). You can also find Quaternion in [various package repositories](https://repology.org/metapackage/quaternion/information).

Most of talking around Quaternion happens in the Matrix room (see above); aside from that, news about the library are regularly posted to [This Week in Matrix](/blog/category/this-week-in-matrix/). Welcome, and have fun!
