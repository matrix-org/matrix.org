This is a minified Android Matrix client derived from the official client. It requires fewer permissions and compiles to a much smaller package.

Full credit goes to the original developers. This fork just shaves-off the following features and dependencies:
   * Jitsi integration (for audio / video conference)
   * React native libraries
   * Application Icon badger
   * Analytics
