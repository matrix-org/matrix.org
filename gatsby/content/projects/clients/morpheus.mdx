Morpheus is a windows focused native desktop Matrix client.

- Not maintained because of lack of time -

It currently is in early stages (alpha) and provides a few features only.
Current features are receving and sending messages, as well as a cache for messages. Planned is the most that's possible, even encryption. To make it progress faster any help is appreciated.
You can find its sourcecode at [github](https://github.com/Nordgedanken/Morpheus/).
