[Element](https://element.io) is a glossy Matrix client for the web built on top of [matrix-react-sdk](https://matrix.org/docs/projects/sdk/matrix.org-react-sdk.html) with an emphasis on performance and usability.

You can use it at [https://app.element.io](https://app.element.io), read more at [https://riot.im](https://riot.im) and get the source from [GitHub](https://github.com/vector-im/vector-web)!

There is also a [desktop version](https://element.io/get-started).

## Riot Web

Element was previously known as Riot ("riot-web".) Several packages were made available:

Taw has created RPM package builds for Fedora, CentOS, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux which are available via [GitHub](https://github.com/taw00/riot-rpm/) and [Fedora COPR](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/taw/Riot/).

Josué Tille has contributed a [Yunohost app](https://github.com/Josue-T/riot_ynh).

A [Nextcloud app](https://github.com/gary-kim/riotchat) is also available.
