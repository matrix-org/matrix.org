**Notice: Since this SDK is no longer maintained, its usage is no longer
recommended. If you're looking for a Matrix SDK in Dart, the [Famedly Matrix
SDK](https://gitlab.com/famedly/company/frontend/famedlysdk) is a good option.**

An SDK written in Dart to connect to Matrix, usable for Flutter.

This SDK is for general use, but mainly being developed for [Pattle](https://pattle.im), an easy to use Matrix app.

Please note that this SDK is still pre-1.0 and in development. Things may still change a lot!

## Usage

   Set the initial `MyUser`, either by logging in to a homeserver:

   ```dart
   final homeserver = Homeserver(Uri.parse('https://pattle.im'));

   var user = await homeserver.login(
     Username('pat'),
     'pattle',
     store: MemoryStore(),
   );
   ```

   Or, from a `Store`, for example, the included `MoorStore`, which uses
   [moor](https://pub.dev/packages/moor):

   ```dart
   var user = await MyUser.fromStore(
     MoorStore(
       LazyDatabase(
         () => VmDatabase(File('/somewhere')),
       ),
     ),
   );
   ```

   Once a `MyUser` has been set up, you can start syncing with:

   ```dart
   user.startSync();
   ```

   All data objects such as `MyUser`, `Room`, etc. are immutable.

   The user has a stream of `Update`s, `user.updates`. An `Update` contains
   the latest 'snapshot' of data associated with the user. It also contains
   a `delta` `MyUser`, where all properties are `null`, except those that
   are changed. For example, if a user started typing in a certain room, and we're
   syncing, there will be an `Update` in `user.updates`, where `delta` has 1
   `Room` in `delta.rooms`, with only the room where the user started typing,
   reflected in `room.typingUserIds`. All other properties of the `Room` will
   be null. This is all assuming that this is the only change in the sync.
   If more happened, it will be reflected in `delta`.

   Use `update.user` to get the complete up-to date copy of all data.
   Note that `rooms`, `timeline`s and `memberTimeline`s may not be a
   complete set of the data, more might need to be retrieved from the
   `Store` or remotely.  You can use `load` on `rooms`, `timeline` and
   `memberTimeline`, to load more items.

   ```dart
   user.startSync();

   // Do something after the first received sync specifically.
   var update = await user.updates.firstSync;

   // ALWAYS use the MyUser from the latest update.
   // It will have the latest data.
   user = update.user;

   print(user.rooms.length);

   // Get more events from the timeline. This also returns an update.
   // Note that because we're doing things before we listen to updates, we
   // might miss some syncs. Even though we've missed some syncs, the update
   // received from the load is the most up to date one, and will contain a
   // user with data from processed syncs in the background.
   update = await user.rooms.first.timeline.load(count: 50);
   user = update.user;

   // Because we called load, the update is a RequestUpdate<Timeline>,
   // which means data is the updated Timeline, now with more items.
   print(update.data.timeline.length);

   // Do something every sync. If you don't use onlySync, you will also
   // receive updates that are caused by a request (such as above, load).
   // If you do a request (such as timeline.load) inside a Stream with all
   // updates, and await for it also in the stream, you will use it twice.
   await for (update in user.updates.onlySync) {
     user = update.user;
   }
   ```
