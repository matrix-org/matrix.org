This library sits on top of the [core application service library](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-node) and provides an API for setting up bridges quickly.

Get it from [GitHub](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge) and have a look at the [HOW-TO](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/blob/master/HOWTO.md) for a step-by-step tutorial on setting up a new custom bridge!

Used by [`matrix-appservice-slack`](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack), [`matrix-bifröst`](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-bifrost), full native [Gitter bridge](https://gitlab.com/gitterHQ/webapp/-/tree/develop/modules/matrix-bridge), and others.
