Matrix.org's JS SDK.

### Quickstart

#### In a browser

Download the browser version from
https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/releases/latest and add that as a
``<script>`` to your page. There will be a global variable ``matrixcs``
attached to ``window`` through which you can access the SDK. See below for how to
include libolm to enable end-to-end-encryption.

The browser bundle supports recent versions of browsers. Typically this is ES2015
or `> 0.5%, last 2 versions, Firefox ESR, not dead` if using 
[browserlists](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist).

Please check [the working browser example](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/tree/develop/examples/browser) for more information.

#### In Node.js

Ensure you have the latest LTS version of Node.js installed.

This SDK targets Node 10 for compatibility, which translates to ES6. If you're using
a bundler like webpack you'll likely have to transpile dependencies, including this
SDK, to match your target browsers.

Using `yarn` instead of `npm` is recommended. Please see the Yarn [install guide](https://yarnpkg.com/docs/install/) 
if you do not have it already.

``yarn add matrix-js-sdk``

```javascript
  import * as sdk from "matrix-js-sdk";
  const client = sdk.createClient("https://matrix.org");
  client.publicRooms(function(err, data) {
    console.log("Public Rooms: %s", JSON.stringify(data));
  });
```

See below for how to include libolm to enable end-to-end-encryption. Please check
[the Node.js terminal app](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/tree/develop/examples/node) for a more complex example.

To start the client:

```javascript
await client.startClient({initialSyncLimit: 10});
```

You can perform a call to `/sync` to get the current state of the client:

```javascript
client.once('sync', function(state, prevState, res) {
    if(state === 'PREPARED') {
        console.log("prepared");
    } else {
        console.log(state);
        process.exit(1);
    }
});
```

To send a message:

```javascript
const content = {
    "body": "message text",
    "msgtype": "m.text"
};
client.sendEvent("roomId", "m.room.message", content, "", (err, res) => {
    console.log(err);
});
```

To listen for message events:

```javascript
client.on("Room.timeline", function(event, room, toStartOfTimeline) {
  if (event.getType() !== "m.room.message") {
    return; // only use messages
  }
  console.log(event.event.content.body);
});
```

By default, the `matrix-js-sdk` client uses the `MemoryStore` to store events as they are received. For example to iterate through the currently stored timeline for a room:

```javascript
Object.keys(client.store.rooms).forEach((roomId) => {
  client.getRoom(roomId).timeline.forEach(t => {
      console.log(t.event);
  });
});
```
