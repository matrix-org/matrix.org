Matrix Redux Wrap was motivated by the need to expose the Matrix protocol via a Redux store. The matrix-js-sdk API does not expose a Redux-like pattern through which data flows but rather a number of asyncronous HTTP-request wrappers and a number of models that encapsulate the objects within the Matrix protocol. These models are updated by a mixture of server responses and API calls and do not necessarily lend themselves to simple mental models or the ability to be incorporated into frameworks such as Flux and Redux.
