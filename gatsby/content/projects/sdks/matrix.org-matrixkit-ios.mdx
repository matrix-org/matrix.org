Matrix.org's reusable UI interfaces for iOS.

While [MatrixSDK](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk) provides an Objective-C API to use the Matrix Client-Server API, MatrixKit provides a higher level, reusable and easy-customisable UI built on top of the SDK.

Put simply, MatrixKit is a set of ViewControllers and Views. An app developer can pick up UI components from this set and insert them into their application storyboard or code. The end application controls what is shown when.

Each of the provided UI components has been designed to run standalone. There are no dependencies between them.

The currently available view controllers are:

* MXKRoomViewController: shows messages of a room and allows user to chat
* MXKRecentListViewController: displays the user's rooms ordered by last activity
* MXKRoomMemberListViewController: a page showing the list of a room's members
