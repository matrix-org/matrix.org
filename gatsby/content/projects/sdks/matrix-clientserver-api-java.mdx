A small and simple java API for the Matrix ClientServer Protocol (see [clientServer api](https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/latest))
The API is still in Beta and known for bugs. If you found or missing a feature one you can create a new issue.

## Usage

### Login

With credentials

```java
//https not supported yet
Client c = new Client("http://matrix.your.server.xyz:8008");  
c.login("examplebot", "wordpass123", loginData -> {  
  if (loginData.isSuccess()) {
    //Do sth with the bot
  } else {  
    System.err.println("error logging in");  
  }
});
```

With Usertoken

```java
//https not supported yet
Client c = new Client("http://matrix.your.server.xyz:8008");  
c.login("Y0ur70ken", loginData -> {  
  if (loginData.isSuccess()) {
    //Do sth with the bot
  } else {  
    System.err.println("error logging in");  
  }
});
```

For an examplebot you can have a look at my [Grep Bot](https://github.com/JojiiOfficial/Matrix-Grep-Bot/)
