[Trixnity](https://gitlab.com/trixnity/trixnity) is a multiplatform Matrix SDK written in Kotlin.
You can write clients, bots, servers and appservices with it.
This SDK supports JVM/JS/Native as targets. [Ktor](https://github.com/ktorio/ktor) is used for the HTTP client/server and
[kotlinx.serialization](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.serialization) for the serialization/deserialization.

Trixnity aims to be strongly typed, customizable and easy to use. You can register custom events and Trixnity will take
care, that you can send and receive that type.
