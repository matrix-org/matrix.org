This open-source library allows you to build iOS apps compatible with
Matrix (<http://www.matrix.org>), an open standard for interoperable
Instant Messaging and VoIP.

This SDK implements an interface to communicate with the Matrix
Client/Server API which is defined at
<http://matrix.org/docs/api/client-server/>.

### Use the SDK in your app

The SDK uses CocoaPods (<http://cocoapods.org/>) as library dependency
manager. In order to set this up:

    sudo gem install cocoapods
    pod setup

The best way to add the last release of the Matrix SDK to your
application project is to add the MatrixSDK dependency to your Podfile:

> Obj-C:
> pod 'MatrixSDK'

> Swift:
> pod 'SwiftMatrixSDK'

If you want to use the develop version of the SDK, use instead:

> Obj-C pod: 'MatrixSDK', :git => 'https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk.git', :branch => 'develop'

> Swift pod: 'SwiftMatrixSDK', :git => 'https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-sdk.git', :branch => 'develop'


### Options

If you want to enable VoIP using the <http://webrtc.org> VoIP stack, add
the following pod to you app Podfile:

    pod 'MatrixSDK/JingleCallStack'

### Overview

As a quick overview, there are the classes to know to use the SDK.

#### Matrix API level

`MXRestClient`

:   Exposes the Matrix Client-Server API as specified by the Matrix
    standard to make requests to a homeserver.

#### Business logic and data model

These classes are higher level tools to handle responses from a
homeserver. They contain logic to maintain consistent chat room data.

`MXSession`

:   This class handles all data arriving from the homeserver. It uses a
    MXRestClient instance to fetch data from the homeserver, forwarding
    it to MXRoom, MXRoomState, MXRoomMember and MXUser objects.

`MXRoom`

:   This class provides methods to get room data and to interact with
    the room (join, leave\...).

`MXRoomState`

:   This is the state of room at a certain point in time: its name,
    topic, visibility (public/private), members, etc.

`MXRoomMember`

:   Represents a member of a room.

`MXUser`

:   This is a user known by the current user, outside of the context of
    a room. MXSession exposes and maintains the list of MXUsers. It
    provides the user id, displayname and the current presence state

### Usage

The sample app (<https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-ios-console>)
demonstrates how to build a chat app on top of Matrix. You can refer to
it, play with it, hack it to understand the full integration of the
Matrix SDK. This section comes back to the basics with sample codes for
basic use cases.

One file to import:

**Obj-C**:

    #import <MatrixSDK/MatrixSDK.h>

**Swift**:

    import SwiftMatrixSDK
