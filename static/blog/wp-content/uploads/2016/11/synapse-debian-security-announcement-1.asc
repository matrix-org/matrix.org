Synapse Debian Package Security Announcement - and Synapse 0.18.3
=================================================================

We were advised of a bug with the LDAP integration an hour ago that allowed
unauthenticated login in certain circumstances when using an old version of the
ldap3 python module (v0.9.x).

Currently, this is only known to affect the debian packages of synapse. A fix
has been pushed, v0.18.2-2, and it is strongly advised for you to update as
soon as possible.

Synapse installed using pip should not be affected, as pip will have bundled a
newer version of the ldap3 module.



UPDATE: Synapse v0.18.3 released

This issue only affects OS (not virtualenv) installations using v0.9.x of the
ldap3 python package (e.g. Debian Stable (Jessie)).  Synapse itself specifies a
dependency on >v1.0 of ldap3, but as the dependency is optional there is a risk
that a stale operating system dependency will be pulled in instead.  To be
safe, 0.18.3 of Synapse has just been released to fix the underlying problem
for anyone using the older ldap3 package, regardless of their OS.
https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/releases/tag/v0.18.3 has the details.

Many thanks to Adrián Pérez for reporting the problem, and to hexa- for
assistance in quickly solving it!
